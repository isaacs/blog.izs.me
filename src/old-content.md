You have likely reached this page by clicking on the "old
content" disclaimer at the top of a very old post on this
website.

Please read this before taking any old content on this site too
seriously, or assuming that it necessarily reflects my current
beliefs or opinions.

I have been on the internet since there was such a thing, meaning
that I'm quite a bit older now than I was when I started. I'm old
enough to remember when [Cool URIs Don't
Change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) was a big new
idea, and old enough to mourn the massive libraries of lost
content whose custodians tragically did not follow that maxim,
libraries whose loss is greater than the (historically
inaccurate, but mythologically compelling) burning of the library
of Alexandria in antiquity.

With that in mind, I endeavor to keep this content up as long as
I can, so that these URIs can be cool and never change (or
redirect to new homes, if they do). That also means, as times
change and I with them, that an ever-increasing majority of the
content on this website was written by effectively a different
person, whose memories and genetics I carry on into the future.

Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a
change.

I am not proud of everything written on this website. In fact,
some of it, I find extremely embarrassing and would never write
today. But I keep it around, because I believe that if you truly
have [no ragrets](/no-ragrets.jpg), if you agree with everything
you've ever said or done and can find no fault in your own past,
then you have not changed, and that is certainly nothing to be
proud of.

May we all grow so much in character that we come to regret the
things we say today.
