<blockquote><p>People are giving Wilson money to thank him for killing an unarmed black teenager. Please report this to GoFundMe, as it violates their Terms of Service and they get 5% of the tens of thousands of dollars being donated. <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/mvc.php?route=contact/form&amp;pid=500_When_should_I_report_a_campaign">Click to report.</a></p>
<p>The “Support Officer Wilson” page url: <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/supportofficerwilson">http://www.gofundme.com/supportofficerwilson</a></p>
<p>This is my message, in case you want to copy and paste:</p>
<p><em>Your Terms of Service prohibit “items that promote… hate, racial intolerance, or the financial exploitation of a crime.” Take a look at the comments that come with the donations on this page and tell me that doesn’t violate your terms. “Support Officer Wilson” is a thin veil for people rewarding Wilson for killing a black kid.</em></p></blockquote>
