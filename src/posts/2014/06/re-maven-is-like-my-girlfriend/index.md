<p><img src="./tumblr_inline_n6pd6oUQGg1qzgxun.jpg" alt="Maven is like my girlfriend; Looks beautiful; Complains a lot; Demands my attention; Interrupts me while I'm working; Doesn't play well with my other friends"/></p>

<p>First of all: wow, misogyny.  As Rick Scott <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowspar/status/474542211288137728">put it</a>, this slide amounts to &ldquo;Bitches. Amirite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/peterc/status/474500361470742528">few people</a> have rushed to Doklovic&rsquo;s defense, claiming, &ldquo;Nono, you misunderstand; he wasn&rsquo;t talking about girlfriends <em>as such</em>.  Of course <em>that</em> would be inappropriate!  No, he was complaining about <em>his specific</em> girlfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spent too many years with a partner who used public humiliation, guilt, and intimidation to get their way.  They complained in public, in my presence, to our mutual friends that I didn&rsquo;t make enough money, while spending it all buying those friends drinks.  This partner told people that dating a nerd is worth all the downsides because they don&rsquo;t have to have a job, and you never know, I might one day create the next Facebook and become a millionaire.  Then in private, when I told them those things really hurt, they&rsquo;d tell me that it was just a joke, and I shouldn&rsquo;t take things so seriously.  That my sensitivity is the reason why they have anxiety problems and can&rsquo;t regulate their emotions without drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p>My self-esteem hit rock bottom.  I was empty for years.  My family didn&rsquo;t recognize me.  I lost most of my friends, and a valuable chunk of my twenties.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I bounced back.</p>

<p>All totaled, the divorce ended up costing over $80,000, and I consider it the best money I&rsquo;ve ever spent.  Thank the universe there weren&rsquo;t any kids or mortgages involved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sharing this for sympathy.  I&rsquo;ve lived very well since my divorce, and I&rsquo;m lucky in more ways that anyone has a right to.  I had the real power the whole time, and just had to recognize it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sharing this so that you understand why, when someone shares a slide like this, proudly making a joke at the expense of their significant other, I am struck by blinding rage.  If this was about me, I would have dumped him via a public tweet.  If I&rsquo;d been in the audience, there&rsquo;s a good chance I would have ended up being kicked out of the event.</p>

<p>Saying &ldquo;Nono, this was about <em>his specific</em> girlfriend, what&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo; is really no defense.  If his girlfriend is a real person, she has real feelings, and I sincerely hope that she has the strength to recognize the problems with this behavior and get out as soon as possible.</p>
