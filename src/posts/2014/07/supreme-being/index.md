| **seldo** | "Enterprise Replicator" should be the name of a service so we can make 'tea, earl grey, hot' jokes. |
| **isaacs** | Oh, also, we should use promises for it. |
| **ceej** | Really?  I'm surprised to hear you say that. |
| **isaacs** | Yeahâ€¦ and I know you all like bluebird, but we should use Q for this.  More powerful. |
| **bencoe** | I see what you did there. |
