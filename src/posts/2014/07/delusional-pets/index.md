| **rockbot** | I know you said no dogs, but can we pleeeeeeeease have a platypus-friendly office!? |
| **isaacs** | I don't know.  Our office is pretty dry.  They need water. |
| **rockbot** | That's why we'd get a tank! |
| **isaacs** | Isn't it also like, super cold here for them? |
| **rockbot** | They're nocturnal!  So it'd just come out at night. |
| **isaacs** | Why not just *imagine* a platypus being here when you're home at night?  This isn't a pet-friendly office, but it's *definitely* a delusion-friendly office. |
| **rockbot** | Really? |
| **isaacs** | Yeah, have you *seen* the spreadsheets and graphs we show investors?  This is a startup, it's practically nothing *but* delusions! |
