<blockquote><p>I am super excited to welcome Raquel “<a href="https://twitter.com/rockbot">@rockbot</a>&ldquo; Vélez to the team at npm, Inc.</p>

<p>Raquel was one of our first picks as an early hire.  We were thrilled when she agreed to join, and it’s great to be able to publicly say so today :)</p>

<p>We do still <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/jobs">need more help</a>, so if you were concerned that this means we’re all filled up, not to worry!  The fact that you might get to work with Raquel is just yet another reason to <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/jobs">get in touch</a>.</p></blockquote>
