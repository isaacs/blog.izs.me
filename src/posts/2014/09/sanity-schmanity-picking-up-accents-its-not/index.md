<blockquote><div class="post_title"><strong>Picking up accents: it’s not weird.</strong></div>
<div class="post_body">
<p>Have you ever been talking with someone from another state or country and caught yourself accidentally picking up bits of their accent? Turns out <em>it’s normal:</em></p>
<blockquote class="xkit-colorquotes-border-item">
<p><em>&ldquo;An experiment with lip-reading has found that the brain subconsciously tries to copy the speech patterns of total strangers.</em></p>
<p><em>Researchers who made the discovery believe accent mimicry is part of the brain’s in-built urge to ‘empathise and affiliate’ with other people. And we don’t even need to hear them saying the words out loud.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So researchers at the University of California did an experiment where they had volunteers watch a silent video of a face saying a bunch of simple words. They gave the volunteers a choice of two words and asked them to say which one they thought the face in the video had said. And look:</p>
<blockquote class="xkit-colorquotes-border-item">
<p><em>&quot;They were not asked to either imitate or impersonate the talker, just say what the word was. </em><em>But amazingly, the tests showed they were more likely to repeat the word in exactly the same accent used by the speaker rather than their own accent.”</em></p>
