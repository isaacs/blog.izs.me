my reply got too long and reddit's server kept not wanting to let
me post it, so I'm writing it here.

I love this. Major topic of speculation, nothing dirty, I just
like looking into my own mind.

> and a lot of that banana will leave me shortly

Just getting the shit talk out of the way early, this is a common
misconception. Poop is mostly water (about 75% by volume) and the
majority of the dry weight is a mix of living and dead bacteria,
only a tiny amount of undigested food. The food you eat is almost
entirely turned into energy, turned into more you, and used to
feed the bacteria living snuggled up in the lower part of the wet
center of the meat torus. Those bacteria smell real bad, and mix
with the undigestible bits of the banana (mostly fiber), to make
the foul smelling paste we call poop. It's actually still got
quite a lot of calories in it, and the bacteria in it keeps on
feasting after it leaves you. The main reason we think it's
stinky is because it's real bad for us to get it in other parts
of our meat machines, so evolution tuned us to try to avoid and
dispose of it. (E. coli and Stroptococcus bacteria anywhere else,
very dangerous.)

But to the point of the post here, I am going to say a lot of
words about this, because I think about it often, and have been
pondering it rigorously, for many decades now.

Let's say you write a program, it's an algorithm that does some
computation. The program is running on a computer. Is the
computer the program? Of course not. You could conceivably copy
the program to another identical computer, and it'd be the same
program, but on a different computer.

Ok, so is the program the specific bits that make up the program
at any given time? You'd maybe be tempted to say yes, but what if
the program is such that it can modify itself? Even then we could
say, sure, the program is the bits, but the program changes.

But what if we then wrote the exact same program, that functioned
in exactly the same way, responding with the same outputs to the
same inputs, etc, but wrote it in a different programming
language. Would it be the same program? Maybe it'd be a different
version of the program, but remember, the program changes over
time anyway, so is this really any more different than the "same"
program one moment to the next? This rewritten version changes
itself in the exact same ways, behaves identically, so it feels
right to say it's the "same" program, even though it has
different specific bits.

So maybe the program isn't the computer _or_ the bits, but the
behavior, the pattern?

And what if it can only run on a single machine that exists, a
bespoke computer built by hand, circuit by circuit, to run this
one program. Then is the program the computer? Are they the same
thing? If the computer can only run this one program, and the
program can only run on this one computer, it feels almost
arbitrary to say where one stops and the other begins.

What then if we rewrote that bespoke single-use computer and
program for a completely different computer, as different as
possible, in fact; one that behaves exactly the same way, but on
this other computer every `1` is replaced with a `0` and every
`0` with a `1`, in every instruction and every circuit. The
program bits literally could not be more different, every single
bit is flipped! But it feels like this is even _more_ faithfully
the "same program" than the one before that was re-implemented in
a different language.

Is a "program" even a real thing? And, obviously, this is all a
metaphor to back into the question: Is a "person" even a real
thing? What _is_ it?

Also, what is a "family"? "Capitalism"? "Gender"? All these
things are just convenient analytical tools with no universal
concrete basis in reality.

Of course, when you get down to it, and pursue physics to the
edge, you'll find you can ask the same exact sort of question
about the "hard" things. What _is_ an electron, really? Is it a
real "thing"? Is it just a pattern of concentrated energy that
exhibits a sort of probabilistic location, mass, and charge in a
way that's mathematically convenient to model as a "thing"? What
even is "thingness", and what would it mean for an electron to be
or not be that, or have or lack that property of "thingness"?

There's an ongoing (for the last 50 years or so, at least) open
field of discussion in epistemology and philosophy of science
about how to view the "weird" mathematical objects of modern
physics, which accurately and reliably predict observations, and
which we can thus very confidently _describe_ to a high degree of
accuracy, but which cannot be (must not be!) "real" in the sense
that "my dog<sup id="i-am-fn-1-back">[1](#i-am-fn-1)</sup>" or "this cup of coffee" is "real".

But what does it mean for _those_ things to be "real"? Isn't
"this cup of coffee" itself just a conceptual model that reliably
and accurately predicts observations I end up experiencing, which
are presumably in some way causally triggered by various
impingements upon my senses by....... whatever the fuck is
actually "real"? But if nothing is "really _really_ real!" like
Arthur Fine's concept of "foot-stamping REAL", then how can we
say _anything_ about _anything_??

So, I always come down on the side of more or less naive realism
(ie, there is a real world, we're in it, and we can describe it
with ever-increasing but imperfect fidelity by doing science) and
non-dualism (what happens in the brain happens in the brain, we
live in reality and are real things). Anything else feels like
cheating or solipsism, and is thus fake loser shit.

That means, if we're gonna say _anything_ is "real", including
me, it's gotta be: a given conceptual representation (whether
"coffee cup", "me", or "electron") is "real" insofar as it
reliably and accurately predicts observations, better than random
chance.

"I'm" real, because the concept of the self predicts behavior
better than random chance. "I'm" also a conceptual invention that
the narrative machine in isaacs' head has concocted. These two
things are not in conflict with one another; in fact they _imply_
one another. I'm real because I exist, and the "I" that "exists"
is a model predicting observable behavior.

Consider the pattern `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...`. You'd probably
recognize this as the fibonacci sequence. But is it "really"? Is
the fibonacci sequence "real"? What if I told you the next number
was `4231`? Then you might say "oh, I _thought_ it was the
fibonacci sequence, but it's not _really_, it's something else."
The pattern is "real" if it accurately describes and predicts
observations. If not, then it isn't.

"You" are not your body, "you" are what your body _does_. That's
real. That's a pattern that can be described conceptually and
very faithfully predicts observations. Autism is likely a big
part of that behavior. Is it a "part of you", or is it "you"?
What's the difference?

If we went into the computer and changed the program so that it's
no longer accurately described/predicted by the conceptual
construct of "autism", then is it a different program? Sure. But
this is a self-modifying program that changes from moment to
moment anyway. That'd be a pretty big break discontinuity, way
more than sleeping and waking up, so maybe it'd be accurate to
say it's a "different program (person) entirely" from that point
forward.

Anyway, that's probably already way too much for reddit. Have a
nice day, enjoy your meat tube (that can get a little dirty, it's
ok).
