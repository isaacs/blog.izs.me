<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t believe everything you hear.</strong>  You will by default.  It takes a lot of effort to un-believe it once you hear it.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t believe everything you think.</strong>  You already do.  That&rsquo;s why you think it.  It takes a lot of effort to un-believe it once you think it.  Many thoughts are demonstrably false, yet we have them anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t believe you know everything you know.</strong>  You already do.  That&rsquo;s why you think you know it.  You have to not just un-believe it, but un-know it.</p>

<p><strong>Beliefs are sneaky.</strong> Beliefs don&rsquo;t look like beliefs; they just look like the world. When you&rsquo;re in the kitchen, you don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I believe I am in the kitchen&rdquo;.  You say, &ldquo;I am in the kitchen.&rdquo;  Un-believing is like un-seeing.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t believe everything you say.</strong> This is the hardest of all.  Our past selves hold our integrity hostage.  Do not negotiate with terrorists.  Shoot the hostage.</p>

<p>Every belief must pay rent, constantly, or be evicted.</p>
