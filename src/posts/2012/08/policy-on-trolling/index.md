<p>The policy in the #node.js irc channel is this:</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> If you&rsquo;re a dick, you get kicked out.  This is not negotiable.</p>

<ol><li>Sexist, heteronormative, racist, and other offensive remarks are not allowed.  (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful or sexually explicit manner.)</li>
<li>Remarks that make any of the ops go &ldquo;Hm, that&rsquo;s inappropriate&rdquo;, whether on the above list or not: also not allowed.</li>
<li>You get a warning.</li>
<li>If the warning is not taken seriously, you <em>might</em> get a second sterner warning in PM, if you&rsquo;re lucky, and the op is feeling generous, and this is the first time.  But don&rsquo;t count on that.</li>
<li>If the warning is unheeded, you get kicked.</li>
<li>If you come back and continue to make trouble, you get banned.</li>
<li>If you contact the offended party, and are truly apologetic, and it was the first offense, and the op who banned you feels it&rsquo;s appropriate, then you may get un-banned.</li>
<li>If an op bans you, I&rsquo;m definitely not going to unban you unless they agree it&rsquo;s a good idea.</li>
<li>If an op bans someone, and you think it was unjustified, take it up with that op, or with a different op, <strong>in private</strong>.  Griping about bans in-channel is not tolerated, and will result in more bans.</li>
<li>Ops are expected to be paragons of virtue.  If an op creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect much less leeway than standard users.</li>
<li><strong>Your free speech is not our problem.</strong>  We recognize that this policy is a restrictive political stance.  That is the intent.  If you want a room with different rules, go create one.</li>
</ol><p>In the majority of cases, this is fine, and never requires anyone to be banned.  Most so-called trolls are immature boys (sometimes actual children, and sometimes just childish) who just need a grownup to tell them &ldquo;no&rdquo; from time to time, perhaps with a light wrist-slap.  A <code>/kick</code> and a 2-minute ban to cool down is usually enough, if the warning didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>However, persistent trolling ruins communities.  No good can come of tolerating it.  In the node community, we are not afraid of losing a few kids who can&rsquo;t manage to behave in a grown-up manner.  We&rsquo;re more concerned with losing the people that those kids chase away.</p>

<p>This policy does not depend on anyone&rsquo;s agreement.  Your sexist remarks in our IRC channel is not protected speech.  The D in BDFL does not stand for &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo;.  Complaining about the ban will not get you unbanned.</p>

<p>A similar policy exists in slightly modified form for NodeConf, the node mailing list, and so on.  It works.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dick, or you&rsquo;ll be kicked out, and crying about it will definitely not help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been in a lot of online communities over the last 20 years.  I have never seen a community fall apart due to excessive banning of trolls, but almost all of them have fallen apart due to excessive trolling.  I&rsquo;d strongly encourage any online community to adopt a similar policy.</p>

<hr><p>This policy and the accompanying justification is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-By license</a>.  In other words, you can use any or all of it for your project or community free of charge, with or without changes, for any commercial or non-commercial purpose, provided that you link back <a href="http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling">to this post</a>.</p>

<p>I have chosen a very liberal license because I want people in the world to be nice to each other, and I believe that part of the way to get there is for more communities to have reasonably low tolerance for bad behavior.</p>

<hr><p><strong>edit</strong>  A prior version of this used the word &ldquo;gentlemanly&rdquo;, contrasting the distinctively boyish nature of most IRC trolling.  In my view, behaving in a &ldquo;gentlemanly&rdquo; manner means that one is respectful, despite being male and in the company of strangers; a definite challenge for many.  For various reasons, virtually every IRC troll in online communities is male.</p>

<p>However, the term has connotations for many people implying a specific sort of politely dismissive and condescendingly sexist attitude; others felt that this colored the entire post in a gendered manner that made the underlying message less clear.</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t my intent, so I changed the term for clarity.</p>

<hr><p>2014-03-17 - Added rules 9 and 10.</p>

<p>2014-10-02 - Changed &ldquo;heterosexist&rdquo; to &ldquo;heteronormative&rdquo;.  Added rule 11.</p>
