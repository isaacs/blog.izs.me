<p>Srsly, github.  Please stop with these.</p>

<p>There is no way to filter these messages except via the title.</p>

<p>No listid header, the return address is &ldquo;noreply@github.com&rdquo;, no option on the github website to &ldquo;Never ever send me a message to tell me about the repo I just created myself because apparently I forgot because I have Alzheimer&rsquo;s or something so I need a reminder about the repo I just created&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And yet I do not have Alzheimer&rsquo;s, yet, as far as I know, and I do get a crazy-making amount of email via github, and it is my job, so I can&rsquo;t simply throw away all of it.</p>

<p>Hence, the filter.</p>
