<p>I&rsquo;m not ever going to try to pretend that I&rsquo;ve got any &ldquo;disenfranchised&rdquo; cred.  In all the ways that show, I&rsquo;m a paradigm example of the ruling class.  But even I can see that Antirez&rsquo;s <a href="http://antirez.com/post/different-take-sexism-it.html">recent post on sexism in tech</a> is just amateurish and sad.  <a href="http://blog.prettylittlestatemachine.com/blog/2012/10/14/antirez-on-sexism/">Shanley&rsquo;s response</a> almost seems a bit <em>mean</em> in how easily she tears into his non-arguments; it&rsquo;s like watching a kitten tossed to a hungry pit bull.  I didn&rsquo;t want to keep reading, but I couldn&rsquo;t look away.  Bravo.</p>

<p>Here are a few uncontroversial facts that men in tech ought to keep in mind:</p>

<ol><li>Most men in tech claim that they are not sexist, and they believe that they are telling the truth.  They honestly think that they treat women equally, that they don&rsquo;t see gender in the workplace, that they judge everyone based on their abilities, etc.</li>

<li>There are many many more men in the tech industry than women.</li>
<li>Women do better in school than men, even in <abbr title="Science Technology Engineering Mathematics">STEM</abbr> majors, and graduate in higher percentages than men.</li>
</ol><p>When faced with a mountain of evidence that I&rsquo;m not capable of seeing something, saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it&rdquo; is really not so compelling.  In fact, faced with that evidence, a reasonable person would probably stop and think, &ldquo;Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t base my decisions on what I can and cannot notice.  Maybe I ought to be a bit more careful, or even <em>take active steps</em> to correct the demonstrable bias.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know.  I&rsquo;m just a white american man who had the benefit of lots of free education, and basically fell into a dream job.  Yeah, I had to sell some drugs to make ends meet in college, and some vacuum cleaners during the dot-com slump.  I&rsquo;ve answered phones in tech support.</p>

<p>But pretty much, it&rsquo;s been an easy ride.  I&rsquo;ve never had someone think <em>I&rsquo;m not good at computers because of my gender</em>.  I gotta think that just HAS to suck.  I realize that most sexism is not on purpose.  But that&rsquo;s the problem.  The explicit chauvinism is easily corrected.  It&rsquo;s the subtle subconscious mistakes that do the real lasting damage.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we talk about women in tech.  That&rsquo;s why we try to get more women to speak at conferences about the work they&rsquo;re doing.  That&rsquo;s why we blog about it, and have events about it.  Because there clearly <strong>is</strong> a bias.  It&rsquo;s one that isn&rsquo;t readily apparent otherwise.  And the way you correct biases isn&rsquo;t by pretending they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>A very valid question is, &ldquo;Why should we care?&rdquo;  Maybe that&rsquo;s what Antirez was trying, in a rather clumsy way, to get at.  What&rsquo;s wrong with tech being composed almost entirely of men?  After all, we should be a meritocracy; what&rsquo;s in your underwear shouldn&rsquo;t matter, right?</p>

<p>The reason we should care is that rational grownups don&rsquo;t just shrug their shoulders when their biases cause hardships for other people.  Rational grownups try to see the world as it is (including themselves), and don&rsquo;t make up excuses for facts.  We should care because a diversity of opinions benefits all of us, and our industry, and we&rsquo;re subconsciously filtering people based on criteria that we claim does not matter.</p>

<p>But mostly, we should care because there are humans being treated like shit, and we are part of the problem.</p>
