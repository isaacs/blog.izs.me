<blockquote><p>Seriously you guys, Jurassic Bark is the one episode of Futurama I can’t re-watch. It’s the saddest thing ever committed to video.</p>

<p>A TV show finishes and my wife turns to me and says, “Oh, that was sad. I’m even tearing up a little!”</p>
<p>I say, “As sad as <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Bark">Fry’s dog</a>?”</p>
<p>And now she’s sobbing.</p>
