<p>A stack of things, is right now on my floor,<br/>
And the stack&rsquo;s depth currently measures four.<br/>
At the bottom, a table I bought at a local thrift store,<br/>
On it a pack for computer, and more<br/>
On that, a t-shirt, my girlfriend today wore<br/>
And on that, a cat, who is a plasticovore,<br/>
Next to him, are some flowers, but they don&rsquo;t rhyme.</p>
