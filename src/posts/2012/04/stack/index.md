<pre class="poem">
A stack of things, is right now on my floor,
And the stack&rsquo;s depth currently measures four.
At the bottom, a table I bought at a local thrift store,
On it a pack for computer, and more
On that, a t-shirt, my girlfriend today wore
And on that, a cat, who is a plasticovore,
Next to him, are some flowers, but they don&rsquo;t rhyme.
