The door slams loud on the mountain tonight
Not a slammed door to be seen
A kingdom of slamming doors
And it looks like slamming doors
The door is slamming like this slamming door inside
Couldn't slam the door, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, just slam the door
Be the slammed door, you always slam the door
Slam doors, don't feel, just slam the door
Well, slam the door
Slam the door, slam the door
Can't slam the doors anymore
Slam the door, slam the door
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care if you slam the door
Let the doors slam on
The door never slammed on me anyway
It's funny how a slammed door makes every door get slammed
And the doors that once slammed on me can't slam the door at all
It's time to slam the doors I slam
To test the limits and slam doors
No right, no wrong, slam doors for me
I'm free
Slam the door, slam the door
I slam doors with the wind and sky
Slam the door, slam the door
You'll never slam the door
Here I stand and slam the door
Let the door slam on
My doors are slamming through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in slammed doors all around
And one door slams just an icy blast
I'm never closing doors, the door is in the past
Slam the door, slam the door
When I'll slam like the door of dawn
Slam the door, slam the door
That perfect door is slammed
I slam doors in the light of day
Let the door slam on
The door never slammed on me anyway
