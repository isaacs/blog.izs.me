<p>Hello, and welcome to my new and much easier to spell domain name.  I previously had <a href="http://isaacschlueter.com">isaacschlueter.com</a>, which I plan on keeping, but I&rsquo;ll probably more-or-less let that domain wither and grow obsolete.  I plan to port a lot of my more technical content over to this new sandbox, and post stuff here from now on.</p>

<p>In the meantime, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo">what WikiPedia has to say about &ldquo;foo&rdquo;</a>.</p>
