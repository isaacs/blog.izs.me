| **isaaczschlueter** | let M = "is married" |
| **isaaczschlueter** | let D = "gets a divorce" |
| **isaaczschlueter** | all D is M |
| **isaaczschlueter** | not all M is D |
| **isaaczschlueter** | therefor D → M |
| **isaaczschlueter** | divorce is the leading cause of marriage! |
| **replicantkitty** | implication ≠ causation |
| **isaaczschlueter** | that's the joke. |
