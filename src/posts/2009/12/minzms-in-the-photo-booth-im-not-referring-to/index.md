<h2>MiNzMs in the Photo Booth</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not referring to the OS X app here, or some fancy iPhone program that takes old-timey crappy photos, but an actual real-live physical photobooth.</p>

<p>This is a ritual that is on the way out.  If you&rsquo;ve never experienced it, I highly recommend it.  Your grandchildren probably won&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

<p>You sit down on the tiny bench.  It&rsquo;s too small for two, or really even for one, so you have to crowd together.</p>

<p>You pull the curtain shut.  There&rsquo;s an illusion of privacy, but you both know it&rsquo;s fleeting, and incomplete, like holding hands on a carnival ride somewhere in the middle of puberty.</p>

<p>For a brief moment, there is a discussion.  You must coordinate, because taking the same picture 4 times would seem somehow wasteful and inartistic.  Nevertheless, you know you&rsquo;ll screw up whatever plans you make, and that it&rsquo;ll be ok.</p>

<p>You put the money in the little slot, and look into the seemingly endless black abyss in front of you, immediately forgetting what poses you&rsquo;d agreed to do.</p>

<p>PHOOMPSH.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>PHOOMPSH.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>PHOOMPSH.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>PHOOMPSH.</p>

<p>And then it&rsquo;s done.</p>

<p>Upon exiting, there&rsquo;s a several-minute wait for the pictures to come out of the slot, sticky and stinking of chemicals; delicate and toxic.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re left, not with a high definition jpg or raw file, but a tiny slip of paper, imperfect and unique, a shared memory squeezed into 4 improbably wonderful slices.</p>

<p>An artifact to be treasured, and there&rsquo;s only one.</p>
