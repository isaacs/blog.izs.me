<pre class="poem">
Joy overwhelms
alters and exposes everything

Smell you on my lips
  taste your scent
Brains buzz
  intoxicated by you

Wrap me in your soul
  arms and legs
    pull me in
Float downstream
  warm oceans sunlit beaches
    bask in your glow

You are a dream.

Come true to me
  when I kiss you.
</pre>
