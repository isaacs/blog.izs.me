<p>Todo:</p>

<p>Once per month, or as often as possible, find an error in judgement that I made in the past—something I really and truly believed and fought for, which was 100% wrong—and publicly announce it.  It&rsquo;s gotta sting.</p>

<p>The goal is to build up a thick skin against the fear of failure.  Failure is natural, it is a learning process, and important.  Resisting the information that comes with failure is disastrous.  And fear of failure is a mind-killer.  My ego might not like doing this, but sometimes you just have to tell your ego to grow a pair.</p>

<p>The first one is a gimme: getting married was a horrifically bad idea.  There&rsquo;s no excuse for it.  It&rsquo;s an outdated institution, but beyond that, we were just a terrible couple.  I wasn&rsquo;t happy.  I should have broken up with her, and instead I proposed.  I have defended the decision countless times, even while going through our separation and divorce, because of a fear of admitting to my family and friends and myself that I was just flat-out wrong on many levels.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that any mistake I make in business or in life will ever be as painful, expensive, or full of public fail.  And yet here I am, happy and successful.  So there is really no reason to fear anything.  I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from that failure, about myself, and about love, and about what I need to be happy.</p>

<p>Admitting failure can be exhilarating.  Try it!</p>
