<p>Good quote: &ldquo;If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly, and even catastrophically, you stand little chance of ever getting rich.&rdquo; Reminds me of this quote from Lazarus Long: &ldquo;People who go broke in a big way never miss any meals. It is the poor jerk who is shy a half slug who must tighten his belt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a bit of a pod who sometimes finds it all too easy to &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; my human concerns, and an on-again-off-again workaholic who was literally ridiculed by my friends for my study and work habits, I am very inspired by what he has to say.</p>
