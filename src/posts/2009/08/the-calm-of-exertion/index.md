<p>Exerted and spent, and yet filled up and satisfied.<br/>
Like a cat in the sun.<br/>
It is work that brings this calm, strengthens the body and mind for another round.<br/>
This is the reward of your effort.<br/><strong>Do not squander it!</strong></p>

<p>How often have I burnt myself out, and felt so overwhelmed, like there was never enough time, never enough of me to cover all the corners, spread and stretched as a sheet over too large a bed, butter across too much bread, thin and weary, cracking and torn, pulled to shreds.  So many times I&rsquo;ve forgotten this lesson, forgotten to pick up my reward, and paid the price for it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve told myself that work is to blame.  I point the finger at the likely suspect, but the fact of the matter is that <em>I</em> was to blame, and didn&rsquo;t want to admit I&rsquo;d caused my own pain.</p>

<p>There is plenty of time.<br/>
Everyone will get by just fine.</p>

<p>Work hard, and rest deeply.  That is the Key.</p>
