<p>Netflix is Doing It Right.</p>

<p>This is how employees should be treated, and how creative knowledge-based companies should be run.</p>

<p>Given that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">short-term incentives motivate far less effectively than a sense of control and ownership</a>, isn&rsquo;t it time that businesses start using what science knows to make their employees more productive?</p>

<p>If I ever go to another BDC after I&rsquo;m done at Yahoo, I&rsquo;ll take a good long look at Netflix.  Now I understand why engineers who go there and seem so happy.</p>
