<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between these three states:</p>

<ol><li>I like X</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m into X</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m good at X</li>
</ol><p>That difference usually amounts to doing whatever it is.  A lot.  But, if you like something, it&rsquo;s hard to admit you&rsquo;re not really into it in any meaningful way.  Maybe you like the beliefs behind open source code, and you admire the people who do it, and think of yourself as one of them.  But you don&rsquo;t actually <em>do</em> it.</p>

<p>The first step to getting good at anything worthwhile is accepting that you&rsquo;re going to suck at it, most likely for a <em>very</em> long time.  If you can master it in a day, it&rsquo;s probably not all that interesting.  The really cool stuff takes years.</p>

<p>So get started, already.</p>
