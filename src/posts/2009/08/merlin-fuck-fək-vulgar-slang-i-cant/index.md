<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/3801577000/"><strong>“fuck |fək| vulgar slang”</strong></a></p>

  <p>I can’t believe the vulgarity in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/apps-and-utilities.html#dictionary" rel="nofollow">Apple’s OS X Dictionary</a>.</p>

  <p>As we speak, millions of OS X users have no idea there’s an “<b>eff word</b>” right on their Mac. Right there. <i>In their home</i>. Where their spouse sleeps. Where their children play with their toys.</p>

  <p>When will Apple finally clean up its act? When will they learn?</p>

  <p>People don’t buy computers to explore the world or learn what things mean; they buy computers to rent PIXAR movies and order iPhones. They certainly don’t buy them to see trash like this. No, sir.</p>

  <p>Shame, Apple. <i>Shame</i>.</p>

  <p>Please take all the words off my computer.</p>
