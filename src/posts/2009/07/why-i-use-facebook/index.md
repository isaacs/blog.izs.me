<p>Facebook is not perfect.  It has a lot of problems, technological and philosophical.  It&rsquo;s a walled garden.  It&rsquo;s easy to put content in, but hard to get it out.  You can&rsquo;t delete anything that goes into their system, no matter how hard you try.  It provides a way for people to pester you who you&rsquo;d perhaps rather forget.  People use it as a proxy for the entire internet, and in so doing, provide a single corporation with control over their communication, and thus, in a way, their very lives.</p>

<p>But every once in a while, something magical happens.  There is a person living across the country.  We&rsquo;re pretty much strangers now, but we knew each other as children, for a few years in passing.  She was randomly reminded of me, and of a memory of our shared childhood, and Facebook gave her an easy way to share this memory without having to commit to much.</p>

<p>Facebook has significantly increased my nostalgia net, and the things that get caught in that net are surprising, intense, and emotionally satisfying in a unique way.</p>
