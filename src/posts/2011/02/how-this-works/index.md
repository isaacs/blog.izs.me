| **programmer 1** | Hey, it turns out you don't need semicolons in JavaScript, and my previous reasons for putting them there are not actually true.  Neat. |
| **programmer 2** | Yeah, but it'll break. |
| **p1** | But... that's just it, it *doesn't* break.  It's actually ok for me to do this. |
| **p2** | No it isn't. |
| **p1** | Why not? |
| **p2** | Browser bugs. |
| **p1** | Which browsers? |
| **p2** | All of them. |
| **p1** | Well, it works fine on all the engines I've tested--- |
| **p2** | IE. |
| **p1** | Works fine there, too.  Even in IE 5. |
| **p2** | Compression.  Compressors can't handle it. Need the semicolons.  All of them. |
| **p1** | All the compressors in use today handle it fine.  In fact, the code compresses a little *better* in most of them. |
| **p2** | Well, whatever, that's not how it's done. |
| **p1** | Ok, well, there are other reasons to do things besides a convention.  I mean, you're wearing an unconventional hat, and that's cool. |
| **p2** | So, now you have a problem with my coding style AND my hat?? FUCK YOU. |
| **p1** | You can code however you want, and I love your hat, I was ju--- |
| **p2** | No.  NO.  Fuck you.  Seriously.  You crossed a line, dude.  Too far. |
| **p1** | [puzzled] I don't get why this an issue, I mean, if you see the spec, it says--- |
| **p2** | You just can't let this go, can you?  Why don't you lighten up? |
| **p1** | Let what go, exactly?  And I don't really think that I'm the one who needs to lighten anything. |
| **p2** | Oh, so now you come in with the personal attacks.  I get it.  We're all not smart enough to understand your precious spec, so you have to attack people?  HAVE YOU NO DECENCY, SIR?  AT LONG LAST, HAVE YOU NO DECENCY? |
| **p1** | I think maybe hacker news isn't for me... |
