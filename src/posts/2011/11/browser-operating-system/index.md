<p>Fairly early in my career as a programmer, I switched from the C and C++ path over to front-end web development. It was fun, in-demand, and provided a way to scratch my artistic and programming itches at the same time.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of that time wrestling with web browsers.</p>

<p>These days, I write most of my JavaScript for node, and run my programs on servers. I&rsquo;ve found that wrestling with operating system differences is very similar to web browsers.</p>

<p><i>(Disclaimer: this is a joke. Please don&rsquo;t email me.)</i></p>

<h2>IE : Windows</h2>

<p>Full of Microsoftisms. Most things mostly work, except that sometimes they don&rsquo;t, and when they do, it&rsquo;s usually in a completely foreign and strange way. So different that many people either don&rsquo;t support it, or don&rsquo;t support anything else.</p>

<h2>Firefox : Linux</h2>

<p>Mostly works, but always awkward. A perpetually broken mish-mash of components that often weren&rsquo;t really intended to be used together. No two are alike, and nothing ever looks exactly right.</p>

<p>Shrouded in a religious belief that it is fixing the worlds problems. Any criticism is viewed as heresy (unless it comes with a patch).</p>

<h2>WebKit/Safari/Chrome : Darwin/BSD</h2>

<p>Very nice, very polished. Would probably die if not for the fact that a huge corporation decided to back it (since we already have a public option with Linux/Firefox). Mostly open source, but if you have to actually do things, you&rsquo;ll inevitably be forced into the &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; APIs, which are not standard.</p>

<h2>Opera : SunOS</h2>

<p>All 12 of its users loudly agree it is superior in every way, and they have graphs to prove it.</p>
