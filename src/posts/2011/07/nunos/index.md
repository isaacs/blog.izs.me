| **nuno** | Email is such a huge part of my life.  I need to say "No" to a lot of people. |
| **isaacs** | It'd be cool if there was an app to do that for you. |
| **nuno** | Yeah, it could be almost like an autoresponder or something. |
| **isaacs** | And you could have some kind of Markov thing to come up with innovative and creative ways to say no to everything. |
| **nuno** | That'd be great! |
| **isaacs** | You should write that.  You could call it "Nuno's New No's". |
| **mikeal** | You were thinking about that for a while, huh? |
| **isaacs** | It was either that or a rhinoplasty joke. |
