Let's not own, control, or colonize<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that's way too much work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one thus attained is worth the cost

Run my software on your brain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;let me live rent-free inside your mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where we can run together through your dreams

Keep that faithful replica<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my voice along with all your others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;telling you all day how great you are

Let my homunculous run wild<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the light of your attention<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let me satisfy the need that he creates

Don't give me grand gestures *(Anyone can do those)*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;give me little signs that take no effort<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but are impossible to fake

A subtle twitch of eyes and cheeks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;when we touch, the whispered sharp inhale<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the smile you can't hide

And when he looks out your eyes into mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and sees the copy of you in my mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the me in you fall in love with the you in me
