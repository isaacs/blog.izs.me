<pre class="poem">Let's not control or colonize
  that's way too much work
    and no one thus attained is worth the cost

Run my software on your brain
  let me live rent-free inside your mind
    where we can run together through your dreams

Keep that faithful replica
  my voice along with all your others
    telling you all day how great you are

Let my homunculous run wild
  in the light of your attention
    and let me satisfy the need that he creates

I don't need grand gestures <i>(anyone can do that)</i>
  give me little signs that take no effort
    and which are impossible to fake

Subtle twitch of eyes and cheeks
  when we touch, the whispered sharp inhale
    the smile you can't hide

When he looks out your eyes and into mine
  and sees the copy of you in my mind
    Let the me in you fall in love with the you in me</pre>
