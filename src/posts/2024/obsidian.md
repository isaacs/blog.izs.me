No exaggeration, [this
story](/2014/10/pb-and-marceline-is-one-of-the-most-poignant-love)
is a better model of healthy nuanced relationship dynamics than
anything I have ever seen in fiction. Certainly better than most
kids will ever pick up from the actual adults in their life.

I'm so thankful that the franchise got to a point where they
could do justice to this romance between a demonic vampire punk
and a sentient candy scientist, even though they are both women.
