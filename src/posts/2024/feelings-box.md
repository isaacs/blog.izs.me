I am about 80% sure I did not initially come up with this
concept. As I remember it, the idea of jealousy in particular
being a "feelings box" was something I originally heard at an
open relationship discussion group some time around mid-2009. But
it's come up 3 times in the last few weeks in various
conversations, and I haven't been able to find any sources online
other than my own tweets. It's possible that I've explored it
enough that it may as well be mine, and so I ought to write it up
here.

There are a few examples of things we often think of and treat
like "feelings" or "emotions" that are in fact not feelings, but
a labeled _box_ of feelings.

A dramatic example of this is "jealousy".

## Jealousy is a Feelings Box

To be jealous is not to have one specific identifiable feeling.
Unlike "true" emotions, "jealousy" is a combination of many
_different_ emotions all jumbled together. We shove those
feelings into a box, put a label on the box, and seal it up
tight. From then on, we only interface with the label, not the
contents.

In the case of jealousy, the label reads: "YOUR FAULT". Then you
huck the box at the person who did the bad thing that made you
jealous, and now it their problem. You are now entitled to demand
that they change their behavior, whatever it was that caused you
to have this box of feelings, rather than unpack the box and
figure out what's really going on.

There is no way to productively address the issue without opening
up that box and really examining what's inside. It may be some
mix of longing, resentment, sadness, grief, anger, anxiety, fear,
even lust or excitement can get stirred up in there! Each of
these are associated with extremely different stories, different
experiences in the body, different framings and conclusions and
reactions and, most importantly, needs. Because the box can
contain emotions with _contradictory_ aspects (eg, grief and
excitement, or resentment and lust), it is all the more important
to tease them apart and address them one by one.

If the box contains resentment, maybe the "jealousy" story is
something like "You're spending so much time with him, that
you haven't been keeping up with your share of the chores. That
extra work is falling on me, and it's not fair." The intervention
here might be something like a clearer structure for
accountability and expectations, to ensure that we all contribute
fairly, and can easily see who's done what.

If the box contains fear and anxiety, maybe the "jealousy" would
be addressed with reassurance and reflection on what it is about
you that your partner appreciates. If it's grief and longing,
maybe it's just that you need to make some more explicit time for
one another to do the things you enjoy together.

If your problem is grief or longing for the relationship you once
had, a chore wheel isn't going to help. If your problem is
resentment, being told how important and valuable you are is
fucking insulting. And if your issue is that you're afraid
they're going to leave you at any moment, it'll be hard to enjoy
doing fun hobbies together.

As long as we interface with the _label_ rather than the feelings
contained in that box, no healing can happen, and any processing
will likely make things worse.

## Happiness is a Feelings Box [<sup>1</sup>](https://twitter.com/izs/status/1744854738997567586)

Similar to jealousy, "happiness" is a labeled feelings box as
well. But in this case, instead of the label ultimately meaning
"YOUR FAULT", the label says "GOOD".

Consider these statements:

- I'm happy that we're going to go to the party together.
- I'm happy that we're here at this party together.
- I'm happy that we had a chance to go to that party together.

3 extremely different emotions! But once _labeled_ with that
"GOOD" tag, we stop looking at it.

"Happiness" might contain satisfaction, bliss, mania, pride,
ecstasy, excitement, or even some less "pleasant" emotions, like
longing or anticipation. In the way that "hope" and "fear"
are two sides of a coin, and work together to take you out of
mindful presence, "happiness" can be just as much an obstacle to
introspective englightenment and connection as jealousy is!

While the jealousy box was mostly some unpleasant or difficult
feelings steming from current or anticipated unmet needs, the
happiness box is usually filled with mostly _good_ feelings.

Why would we hide those from ourselves?

It's important to realize that our minds and brains are not
goal-optimizing machines or rational hedonic maximizers. Like
everything else made by evolution, our minds are optimized for
reprodutive fitness, with survival as a means to that end. So,
they take shortcuts to conserve energy and offload work whenever
possible.

It is much less effort to _want_ to be happy than to actually
figure out _how_ to be happy or get the thing that will _make_ us
happy. The quest to "define" happiness is futile; it is not one
thing, but a contextual framing of many different contradictory
states, grouped by a label. By interacting with the label instead
of the states themselves, we can bemoan our lack of happiness,
without ever being compelled to make the changes that would bring
us more happiness.

## Other Cases (Exercises for the reader)

Consider how this concept is at play in the concepts of:

- Loyalty (and especially, how this contrasts with "integrity")
- Respect (eg, when it means "deference to authority" vs when it
  means "being allowed to exist")

In these cases, what might be in the box? How does the label
prevent us from seeing and addressing that?
