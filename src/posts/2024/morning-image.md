```
immaculately imperceptibly impossibly softly
  hairs of forehead silk rest warm
    on closed satin eyelid

sleep breath sweet musk
  soft warm vapor waves
    on rough black sand beach cheek

sun invades with welcome warmth
  unwelcome wakefulness
    resisted, burrowing

hands with no expression
  rest on smooth expanse of flesh
    ignore the beating heart beneath

languorous left-over libido, last night's lust
  lactic lipids left lovely lounging lingual
```
