This post is an exploration of a [half-baked
theory](https://twitter.com/izs/status/1246361720181776384).
Consider it as an optional thought technology, which you may
choose to employ or not as it proves useful.

I have found this to be a worthwhile mental tool in navigating
the neurotypical/allistic world as an autistic person. Whether it
is "true" or "valid" or has strong predictive power is less
important.

Content warnings, this post mentions (in the abstract) grief and
pet-related tragedy, and links to a few websites that contain a
mix of very good and _exceptionally_ terrible ideas. And it is
possible that merely being aware of this tool may change your
brain and cause you to think in new ways, in case that is
something you'd like to avoid.

## CLT and Modal Thinking

[Construal level
theory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152826/pdf/nihms314649.pdf)
is a model of psychological distance, the mental leaps that we
make in order to reason about and experience that which does not
affect the self directly.

As the authors put it:

> People directly experience only the here and now. It is
> impossible to experience the past and the future, other places,
> other people, and alternatives to reality. And yet, memories,
> plans, predictions, hopes, and counterfactual alternatives
> populate our minds, influence our emotions, and guide our choice
> and action. How do we transcend the here and now to include
> distal entities? How do we plan for the distant future,
> understand other people’s point of view, and take into account
> hypothetical alternatives to reality? Construal level theory
> (CLT) proposes that we do so by forming abstract mental
> construals of distal objects. Thus, although we cannot
> experience what is not present, we can make predictions about
> the future, remember the past, imagine other people’s reactions,
> and speculate about what might have been. Predictions, memories,
> and speculations are all mental constructions, distinct from
> direct experience. They serve to transcend the immediate
> situation and represent psychologically distant objects.
> Psychological distance is a subjective experience that something
> is close or far away from the self, here, and now. Psychological
> distance is thus egocentric: Its reference point is the self,
> here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be
> removed from that point—in time, space, social distance, and
> hypotheticality—constitute different distance dimensions.

Research on <abbr title="Construal Level Theory">CLT</abbr> has
shown an interesting effect. We evaluate and respond to ideas in
_radically different ways_, depending on this perceived
psychological distance. This difference can sometimes shift our
reactions in ways that are surprisingly at odds with an
"objective" evaluation. Consider the following statements:

_Statement 1_

> The average lifespan of a felis domesticus kept indoors is 12
> to 18 years. Outdoor cats live 5 to 10 years on average.

_Statement 2_

> My cat just died. I've had her since I got her as a kitten
> in 2002. I can't believe she's gone.

Consider: which of these statements is more sad?

Even though the cat referenced in the second statement lived
several years longer than the average cat lifespan, it _feels
sadder_ because it's phrased in a way that indicates it is
_close_. It's not just "_a_ cat", it's "_my_ cat".

Furthermore, when
[primed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_%28psychology%29)
with concepts associated with psychological closeness, we tend to
use this "near mode" style of thinking. When primed with concepts
associated with greater psychological distance, we tend to use
"far mode" thinking.

In other words, the degree of sadness we feel about the shortness
of cats' lifetimes has less to do with the length of said
lifetimes or the number of cats suffering such an early demise,
and more to do with whether we are primed to consider feline
death as a _near_ event or a _far_ event, with respect to
psychological distance from ourselves and our spheres of
concern.<sup

## Psychogical Distance, Modal Thinking, and Autism

This has a lot of interesting effects and impacts in how we go
about our lives. Simply noticing the shifts in modality can
illuminate a great deal about how and where we direct our
attention, and how this impacts us.

- We tend to evaluate the choices and needs of others in far
  mode, but our own in near mode, leading to harmful hypocrisy.
  As [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com) has put it, "_Other
  people_ are big dumb idiots, but I have _reasons_."
- We experience our current state in near mode, but our past
  states in far mode, leading to the sense that we are always
  doing our best, and yet our past self seems to have always
  sabotaged us.
- Similarly, we tend to consider our future states in far mode,
  so casually agree to write a whole blog post in a few months,
  not realizing that in a few months we'll be just as busy as we
  are right now, if not moreso<sup
  id="clt-fn-lol-back">[3](#clt-fn-lol)</sup>.

All of the above is the work of professional academics who, for
any of their human shortcomings, seem to have all done this work
conscientiously. What follows is my own reckon, based on personal
experience. I have limited confidence that it is "true" per se
(though it would be an interesting area to research!) But I _do_
know that I have gotten value from it.

**Autistic people seem to have much greater variance regarding
which ideas, phrases, and concepts trigger near-mode experience,
and which trigger far mode.** By comparison, allistic people seem
to be much more consistent in this regard.

## Priming Near vs Far (Intentionally or Implicitly)

There are countless layers of semantics implicit in most bits of
human communication, and priming the listener to consider a
subject at a given psychological distance is a lot of what's
going on. The overlapping layers can get very subtle and
interesting.

For example, it can be good to use "I-statements" to speak about
our own emotions and needs in a difficult conversation. This
signals that the speaker is operating in near-mode, and thus is a
subject of empathy, _while at the same time_, permits the
listener to receive the _information_ in far-mode. We're not
putting the statement "onto them", so to speak, so they are
primed to consider it more abstractly, and feel less need to take
it personally or get defensive. It's not an "accusation", it's a
problem that I have and would like your help with.

A near-vs-far tug of war is also the reason for much of the
linguistic techniques employed in politics and sales.
It's why sales people will pepper their sentences with "today"
and use your name repeatedly when talking about the problem their
product solves, but then switch to complicated abstractions and
payment options when it's time to discuss the price. They want
you to _feel_ the need to buy, and disconnect fro the pain of
paying for it.

The same technique is how political leaders can inspire entire
nations of otherwise sensible ethical citizens to commit
atrocities ranging from environmental destruction to mass murder
and genocide. We are shown graphic images and messages convincing
us that **they** are coming for your family in particular,
inciting moral panic. But when it's time to disclose how much
horror our policies or military have _inflicted_, suddenly it's
"casualties" and big numbers and maps of faraway places. "Won't
_somebody_ think of _the children_!?" takes on a sinister
double-meaning; we are hypersensitive to imagined present-day
threats to our children, but can casually ruin the world they're
going to inherit, or bomb entire societies out of existence.

It's also the method behind the madness of a lot of [corporate
non-apologies](https://blog.izs.me/2015/09/how-to-apologize/).
When we say "mistakes were made" and "we apologize _if_ any harm
was caused", we're distancing ourselves from the decisions and
the harm they caused. This subtly signals that the speaker is
unwilling to consider the situation in near-mode, which can of
course be infuriating if the one being "apologized" to is dealing
with some unpleasant near-mode effects. It's also why the "I'm so
sorry!" part of most apologies can backfire; it centers the
apologizer's feelings and demands empathy for _their_ pain, when
it should be the _recipient's_ harm that is the focus!

My favorite example of absurd corporate distance-priming is the
airport scene in Fight Club. ["Of course, it's company policy
never to imply ownership. We have to use the indefinite
article."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR_1J8VIyKI&t=80s)

When you've lost a loved one, one of the most brutally close and
painful experiences humans have, and find yourself surrounded by
friends and relations at a funeral, think about the things that
they typically say. "She's in a better place." "At least he
doesn't have to suffer any more." "They'll live on in our
hearts." These are all attempts to move your thinking into far
mode.

In fact, the entire experience of grief, with its stages and
emotional rollercoasters, whether due to death or just a simple
breakup, can be seen as a mind struggling to move a near-mode
emotional experience into a far-mode memory, letting them become
[somebody that you used to
know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY). Even after
rage and depression subside, the casual thought that you should
give them a call or the expectation to see them around the
corner, coming from a habit of near-mode consideration, can show
up and open the wounds all over again.

Near/far priming doesn't only need to be linguistic. We consider
things like "warmth" to be near-mode, and "coldness" to be
far-mode. If you want your audience to be primed to offer empathy
and see you as part of their in-group, a person they do favors
for and trust to help them out in return, [give them a warm
beverage to
hold](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1162548).
(Perhaps this is why we so often serve coffee at business
meetings?)

## Autistic vs Allistic, Near and Far

This insight has helped me immensely in understanding _and
explaining_ my autistic experience, and the cases where I and the
allistic people in my life seem to be living in entirely
different universes. Tedious disclaimers, this is my
own experience, etc., but I do believe it is a somewhat
common autistic pattern.

Conceptual structures and systems are the farthest of far mode
triggers for most allistic people. For me, I experience them
quite like a part of my body. It wasn't until fairly recently
that I realized when other software developers say they need to
"feel out" a bit of code, they were speaking metaphorically. I
mean that literally. I _feel_ it with my mind like I'm
manipulating the abstraction with a phantom limb.

While I of course care about being liked by others, for its
emotional validation and instrumental value, it is an extremely
far-mode thing for me, especially with regards to arbitrary
social customs. I find it hard to care _directly_ about
popularity or social judgement in the way that most allistic
people seem to. "Shame" doesn't make a lick of sense to me; I
sort of understand it abstractly, but I'm not sure I've ever
actually felt it. For most allistics, shame is an extremely
powerful near-mode motivator, to the point where many find it
difficult to imagine being moral for any other reason.

I am completely and unwaveringly insistent that employees are not
property, which is not controversial for most people in the
abstract. But for me, it does not feel "abstract". This has led
to several conflicts in the past, when I vocally defend someone
who leaves the company for a better job, even though it was
really inconvenient for us, or fail to be upset when a rival
"poaches" a member of our team. The assumption is that I must not
care about my team, when nothing could be further from the truth.
I just _also_ care about the person leaving our team.

This also helps illustrate the fiery passion of someone like
[Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg)
with respect to climate change. Sadly for the long-term
viability of us human earthlings, most people view global warming
as an extreme far-mode concern. For Greta, it is clearly present
and visceral, as near-mode as it gets.

Few cases illustrate this divergence as clearly as the
confounding (to allistics) autistic moral compass. As Myk
Bilokonsky
[summarized](https://twitter.com/mykola/status/1515660532828758016)

> Autistic people are more likely to stick to their values, even
> in private and even when tempted with personal gain, than
> non-autistic people are.
>
> Researchers of course framed this as a deficit.

What is fascinating to me is not so much the study itself, or the
rather offensive way in which the autistic approach was framed,
but the conversation that it sparked.

- "I get money" is near mode for both allistic and autistic.
- "People will find out I'm bad and judge me" is intensely near
  mode for allistic, but tends to be far-mode autistic.
- "I violated a value" is far mode for allistic, but near mode
  for autistic.

Psychological distance is an important load-bearing aspect of
communication and interpersonal behavior, as it dramatically
shapes how we think and feel. Because most allistics have more or
less similar models of near vs far, it's nearly automatic in most
cases for them to prime their communication partners in the
manner that they wish. By simply speaking in ways that are
natural for the psychological distance the speaker feels, in all
likelihood the recipient of the communication will be easily
primed to feel the same way, as it will tend to align with their
own natural sense.

When someone treats a concern in near mode, which to you is far
mode, it's often annoying. The speaker might seem overly
sensitive or just... _weird_. "Cool story bro... you sure are
into that, I guess." They might even do that "here we go..."
sigh, half-smile, and side-glance to the others in the
conversation to subtly commiserate about the weirdo they have to
suffer politely. (If you are autistic, I'm guessing you know that
look, and the social rejection that inevitably follows.)

However, when someone treats a concern in far mode, which to you
is near mode, it's confusing. Perhaps even "doesn't he notice his
hair is on fire???" confusing. The conclusion is that it's
entirely NOT a concern for that person. "His head must be
fireproof...?"

So, to take an example from above, Mary leaves our company to
join Acme, Inc., our rival. This leaves us short-staffed, and
scrambling to fill the gap. Such betrayal! We all know that Acme,
Inc. is paying her more, and offering Mary a position that we
don't have available, which she's wanted for a long time. Double
betrayal! We trained her and then she walked out the door to do
that job somewhere else!

From my point of view, the "betrayal" is a very abstract notion.
Yes, it's inconvenient and I'd rather things were different, but
that's just how it goes, people move on. The notion that someone
would stick around even though working here isn't in their
interest? That feels perverse to me.

So when I seem to be unphased by Mary's obvious betrayal, the
allistics around me are left with some seemingly obvious
theories:

- I didn't like Mary, wanted her gone, but for some reason never
  said so, and in fact praised her work. So from now on, any
  time I say something good about an employee, it's suspect.
- I don't care about the team having to do more work, or
  scrambling to fill the empty position, or about our company's
  ability to retain talent.

In fact, I'm just more likely to identify with the employee
themselves than the company, and genuinely wish the best for
them. We all cheer when someone leaves another company to come
join us, why would it be good in one direction, and evil in
another? Just because we stand to benefit? Feels petty.

Autistic people make this error as well, when evaluating the
priorities and behaviors of allistic people. In the conversation
around the study above, you see autistic people wondering if
allistic people "even have morals", just as the researchers
theorized that the autistic participants were deficient in their
concern for social pressure, and framed this as "inflexible".

In other words, rather than imagine that someone else views a
concern in a _different construal level theory modality_, we tend
to assume that either:

- they are stubborn and over-sensitive (if the concern is
  far-mode for us, and near-mode for them),
- or that they _lack the concern entirely_ (if it is near-mode
  for us, but far-mode for them).

This almost never yields understanding.

## No Monoliths

As the saying goes, "If you've met one autistic person, you've
met one autistic person".

And this is part of that [half baked
theory](https://twitter.com/izs/status/1246361720181776384). It's
not that "allistics are this one consistent way, and autistics
are this other consistent way". It's that allistics are largely
consistent as a group, and autistics are _extremely diverse_,
with respect to our application of psychological distance.

This is something I'd very much like to see studied in greater
depth.

I've observed this cause problems among autistic people _just
like it does between autistic and allistic people_, with many of
the same assumptions and misconceptions as a result. What is
brutally near-mode for one neurodivergent person may be extremely
abstract and distant for another.

However, at least in those scenarios, I've found autistic people
tend to have an appreciation for the experience of psychological
distances being out of alignment. After all, that's the story of
our life. And as is often the case, the tools we can use to get
along with each other are the same tools that can prove useful in
getting along in an allistic world, and vice versa.

## Using Modal Shifts

Using this thought technology deliberately in practice takes a
bit of work, but I believe it is worth the effort, for people of
any neurotype who wish to understand people and work together
more effectively.

1. **Know Thyself**

   Practice identifying in your own mind and experience, when
   you are thinking in near mode vs far mode. Do you tend to
   spend more time in one than the other?

   The stereotypical (and likely wrong) autistic answer is to
   assume that we spend most of our time in far-mode. "I am
   cold untouchable robot, everyone says so, and that is safe
   and powerful."

   But I'd encourage you to consider those things that send you
   into a spiral of sensory sensitivity, rejection dysphoria, or
   whatever it is that brings you to the brink of a meltdown.
   That's some near mode stuff right there; most likely something
   that feels _very_ close to you, but far to everyone else, and
   the resulting lack of support or acknowledgement can be
   frustrating to tears.

   What are the things that feel close? What things feel far
   away?

2. **Consider Alternatives**

   Can you think about your near mode concepts in far mode?
   Your far mode concepts in near mode? This can be very
   challenging, because you're essentially asking your brain to
   think and feel differently than is natural for you.

   Try to identify situations and conversations where you did
   your level best to try to help someone, to be kind and
   considerate, but it all seemed to go sideways before you knew
   it, and they were hurt and angry, called you uncaring. Is it
   possible that you were acting from a far mode thinking style,
   while they were bringing you a near mode concern? What would
   it have been like to be in near mode in that sitation?

   On the flip side, identify those situations which are a Very
   Big Deal, and no one around you seems to care as much as they
   ought to. Is it possible that they are evaluating this
   situation in far mode, while it is near to you? What would
   it look like to consider the situation abstractly? How can
   you express your needs in terms that make sense to that far
   mode approach?

   What clues were they giving you about the mode they were in?
   What did they say or do, what did they pay attention to? How
   might you or they more clearly "primed" one another to get
   everyone on the same page?

3. **Practice Shifting**

   Our minds will shift modes in response to priming. If you
   can identify these priming triggers, it's possible to
   willfully shift your own psychological construal level. You
   can bring the far near, and push the near away, by shifting
   the mental frame.

   As a safe practice, with plenty of time and space, alone and
   apart from distractions, consider an event or idea which is
   very far mode for you, but which someone else experiences in
   near mode. Imagine not just that it is happening to you, in
   the typical sense of "putting yourself in their shoes".
   Imagine that _you care about it in the same way they do_, as
   a near mode concern.

   Then turn it around. Consider something that is very close
   and visceral to you, and try to zoom out. What if you didn't
   care about it that much? What if it was happening to a
   character in a movie, that you were watching in the
   background? What should that character do? What would be
   optimal?

There is no such thing as a "correct" neurotype, or "accurate"
cognitive modality. We all experience the world and ourselves
with the minds we have, and these minds are modal, subtle, and
complicated. But we _can_ improve our ability to use these minds
and make them work for us.

I hope that you find this tool useful.
