<p>I&rsquo;m a little behind in posting this, since it&rsquo;s been live and in the media for a while now. <a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com">Go check it out: http://buzz.yahoo.com</a></p>

<p>It took a lot of work to pull this thing together.  Monday night was the craziest month of my web development career, culminating in <a href="http://twitter.com/isaacschlueter/statuses/759204492">this tweet</a> posted as I finished pushing the last packages out into production.  <small>I managed to ignore the page that came in 5 hours later. I wonder if it was some kind of subconscious self-preservation that made me leave my phone on vibrate when I finally went to bed.  Sorry bout that, Trang.</small></p>

<p>And despite the <a href="http://valleywag.com/357006/screenshots-of-yahoo-buzz-a-digg-competitor">rather disappointing leak</a>, it seems to have been <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_yahoo_buzz_is_a_brilliant_idea.php">pretty well received</a>.</p>

<p>We worked really hard on this project, and while it&rsquo;s definitely still a &ldquo;beta&rdquo;, the feature set is enough to be interesting, in my opinion.  All in all, this has been a highly rewarding product to be a part of, and I&rsquo;m extremely proud to have been a part of the team that built it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of moving onto a different team, and I have mixed feelings about the transition.  On the one hand, the team I&rsquo;m joining is doing some truly ambitious and interesting things, and it&rsquo;s more in the direction that I want to go.  I&rsquo;ve been starting to get tired of building one web site after another, and this will be an opportunity to do something much more in the &ldquo;web application&rdquo; direction.  On the other hand, the Orion team is one of the best groups of developers I&rsquo;ve ever worked with, and it&rsquo;s sad to leave them.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the joy of working at a company like Yahoo&mdash;if you get bored of doing one thing, then there&rsquo;s always something else, and no matter which team you&rsquo;re on, there are lots of top-notch developers among your coworkers.</p>
