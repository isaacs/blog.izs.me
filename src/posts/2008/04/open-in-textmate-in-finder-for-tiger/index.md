<p><a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-in-textmate-from-leopard-finder">This post</a> has a great little droplet that can be added to the Finder toolbar to open either the selected items or the current Finder folder in TextMate.</p>

<p>Sadly, it doesn&rsquo;t work in Tiger, and I haven&rsquo;t made the jump to Leopard yet.  If you&rsquo;re a TextMate user who&rsquo;s still on Tiger, and wants this feature, I tweaked Henrik&rsquo;s AppleScript to play nice with Tiger.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
