    Time is an illusion that helps things make sense
    So we are always living in the present tense
    It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends
    But you and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then

    Singing: Will happen, happening, happened
    Will happen, happening, happened
    And will happen again and again
    Cause you and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then
    Will happen, happening, happened
    Will happen, happening, happened
    And we'll happen again and again
    'Cause you and I will always be back then

    If there was some amazing force outside of time
      to take us back to where we were
    And hang each moment up like pictures on the wall
    Inside a billion tiny frames so we can see it
      all, all, all

    It would look like, will happen, happening, happened
    Will happen, happening happened
    And there we are again and again
    'Cause you and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then
    Will happen, happening, happened
    Will happen, happening, happened
    And there we are again and again
    'Cause you and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then
    You and I will always be back then
    That's why
    You and I will always be best friends

I know rationally that Adventure Time is over.  I saw it coming, and
heard it rumored, and heard the wails of anguish over it from friends,
and consumed by some unconscious fear of my own mourning, I slowed
down watching the show, and gradually fell further and further behind.

The ending is waiting for me in the future, bittersweet and beautiful.

It will happen.  Until then, Adventure Time is still happening.
