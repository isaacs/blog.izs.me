<blockquote>
<p>See, what you need to understand is that “Not all guys [are] like that” is never going to work. Because you’re answering an entirely different conversation than what women are actually saying.

</p><p>You think women are saying “Every man is a predator and a danger to me.” And you’re replying, “But I’m not like that.”

</p><p>But women aren’t saying that. They’re saying “There are too many situations where women have to worry about their safety,” and you’re saying “That’s not important.” They’re saying “Women are constantly told it’s their fault if something bad happens,” and you’re saying “Don’t worry about it.” They’re saying “Too often, women find their trust violated by men,” and you’re saying “But you should trust <em>me</em>!”

</p><p>They’re saying “So many men have decided that what they want is more important than anything about a woman.” And you’re replying “I’m <em>exactly</em> like that.”</p></blockquote>
