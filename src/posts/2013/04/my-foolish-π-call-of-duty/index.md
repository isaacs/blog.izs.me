<p>A few days ago, I broke my Twitter.</p>

<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/scienceporn/status/319234414360010752">this
tweet</a>
which links to <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/5V0zC47WR2">this image</a>.</p>

<p>Knowing that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number">normal
numbers</a> are not
necessarily the same as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number">irrational
numbers</a>, I thought,
&ldquo;Oh!  How interesting, there must be some proof that π is normal!  I
wonder if they have a link, because I&rsquo;d love to read it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The image, of course, presumes that an infinite
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom">pseudorandom</a> sequence of
digits will contain every digit.  (That is, that any irrational number
will be normal in base-10, so long as it contains every digit.)</p>

<p>Foolishly, perhaps, I
<a href="https://twitter.com/izs/status/319235048823992320">replied</a>, and in
the last few days, I&rsquo;ve been getting about 10 responses per day
saying, roughly, <strong>DURRR!!! DONT YOU KNOW INFINITE MEANS HAS EVERY
NUMBER LIKE THE MONKEYS WRITE SHAKE SPEAR?</strong></p>

<p>As a simple proof, consider a number, very close to π, but different
in the respect that any time a <code>41</code> appears, it is replaced by <code>14</code>.
Let&rsquo;s call it P.  It would start
3.1<b>14</b>59265358979323846264338327950288<b>14</b>971
and continue on forever.</p>

<p>If π is indeed normal in base 10, then clearly P would not be.
Because any digit sequence that goes <code>41</code> would instead go <code>14</code>, so
you could never find the first 4 digits of π within the digits of P.</p>

<p>But P is also infinite, irrational, and pseudorandom.  It would
contain exactly the same ratio of digits as π does, but <em>not</em> have
every combination.</p>

<p>For the first few days, I explained this over and over again.  Since
then, I&rsquo;ve simply accepted that my &ldquo;replies&rdquo; tab on Twitter is
temporarily useless.</p>

<p>As it turns out, π has <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/pi-random.html">NOT been proven to be
normal</a>,
though it passes all known tests for normality, meaning that it has
not been proven to <strong>not</strong> be normal either.  The same is true of
<code>log(2)</code>, <code>e</code>, the square root of 2, and many other natural constants.
What makes matters worse, there is not (yet?) any proof that these
things can or cannot be proven, so it may be a wild goose chase as
infinitely irrational as π itself!</p>

<p>As one might expect, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXoh6vi6J5U">Vi Hart covered this math question in the most
entertaining fashion
possible</a>.</p>

<p>If there was a proof that π is normal, then this would be a
groundbreaking mathematical insight of historic proportions.</p>

<p>It saddens me deeply that the internet is so full of fools who think
that such a revolution has not only already occurred, but is obvious
and foolish to even wonder about.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Duty calls.</p>
