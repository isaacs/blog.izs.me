#### _And so to start with..._

As the meaningless universe expands from the hot beginning of
all things towards the cold infinite nothing, there are Four
Aspects of the Mind of God, and Four Divine Forces spring forth
from them.

The Four Aspects are:

1. Charge,
2. Length,
3. Time,
4. and Mass.

The Four Forces are:

1. Strong,
2. Weak,
3. Electromagnetism,
4. and Gravity.

It is this last that Gravitationists worship, **Our Lady
Gravity**.

She is the most ineffable, yet most visible at our scale. At
macro scales much larger than ours, She rules unopposed. She is
simultaneously strong and gentle, yet nevertheless as ruthless as
any God could be, uncaring towards petty human concerns, capable
of bending space and time to Her divinely ordered whim, or
casually crushing us beneath the rocks of misfortune.

The other three forces are stronger, in absolute terms. But
Strong and Weak are not inverse square laws, and they operate
only on subatomic scales, on the order of femtometers, dictating
how the nucleus of an atom holds together, or decays. Outside of
this tiny domain, they have no detectable power.

Our Lord Electromagnetism is a being of mystery and powerful
magic. He keeps the mostly empty atoms from falling in on one
another, and moves in fae spirals via spooky action at a
distance. He can draw together, but also push apart. While His
reach is theoretically infinite in distance, His tendency to
self-eradicate limits the scope of His reach. He is the source of
much of our most useful magics. In fact, today it's hard to
imagine what life would be like without the miracles we obtain by
harnessing His blessings. His magic gives us life.

Our Lady Gravity is quite different from all of these. Her effect
is much gentler; it can be temporarily overcome merely by the
legs of a child who jumps into the air. But, that effect is
always strictly in one direction. She never pushes; She _only_
pulls. And Her reach is inifinte. She binds the entire universe
together in the gossamer filaments of Her mysterious will.

She is responsible for the shape and motion of the largest
objects in our universe: planets, stars, moons, galaxies,
nebulae, galactic clusters, and so on. Her power is invoked by
the mere existence of mass, and it bends and twists time and
length. When enough of Her attention is concentrated, She punches
a hole in the fabric of reality, creating event horizons that
fully swap time and space, replacing a location with a moment,
tearing the quantum foam in a simmering flurry of antimatter
radiation.

## Worship

In addition to various holidays described below, we honor Our
Lady through regular communion in the form of resistance
training. In this way, we witness Her divine might upon our
fleshy bodies.

Having pushed heavy objects to higher energy states repeatedly,
we then recover in Her firm embrace, allowing ourselves to sink
deeply into rest.

That is, we engage in a hypertrophic strength focused resistance
training regimens, possibly involving weights or just the weight
of our own bodies, featuring adequate rest and recovery between
progressively overloaded muscular stimulus.

Gravitationists thus always endeavor to get stronger and denser,
as an act of religious devotion. Like Our Lady, we exert our
power to increase the concentration of mass under our control.
This improves mental and emotional health, and thus the ability
to reflect on our place within the universe, and to accept the
precarity of our smallness with open eyes and focused minds.

## Holy Days and Seasons

We recognize and pay tribute to Our Lady Gravity in the
recognition of the eight seasons, each marked by a holy day and a
moment of orbital significance:

1. Winter (and [Xmas](/2009/08/holidays/))
2. Imbolc
3. Spring
4. Beltane (and [4/20](/2009/08/holidays/))
5. Summer (and [Birthday](/2009/08/holidays/))
6. Lughnasadh
7. Autumn
8. Samhain (and [Thanksgiving](/2009/08/holidays/))

Each solstice, equinox, and cross-quarter day involves a
different set of practices and meditations to bring our awareness
to the fact that we are animals on a rock riding on the straight
paths through Our Lady's elliptically curved spacetime.

If you would like a calendar with the specific moments of each of
these events, [you can subscribe to this
one](https://izs.me/solar-events.ics) in your calendar app of
choice.

Note that the cross quarter days are not simply halfway between
the relative solstice and equinox, because Our Lady Gravity
swings us in [ellipses around
barycenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter_%28astronomy%29),
not mere circles around some arbitrary point. Even the sun
[orbits the center of the solar
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit). There
is no fixed privileged point in the universe!

_Note: the season descriptions here are related to the Northern
Temperate sect of Gravitationism, its original founding division.
In the Southern Temperate offshoot sect, they are inverted, and
the seasons in the Tropic and Polar sects are very different
indeed. These are all valid, and adherents of Gravitationism are
encouraged to reflect on the seasons as they occur in whatever
locations they feel the most connection to._

Daylight is at a minimum. Rate of change of daylight is zero. A
new year is born!

Xmas, the holiday of [Social Reflection](/2009/08/holidays/),
occurs near the start of this season, a few weeks before
perihelion.

Consume calories, hold your loved ones tight. Meditate on the
connections that keep us warm.

The night is dark and full of terrors, but as the perihelion
occurs shortly after the Winter solstice, this season is
thankfully the shortest.

### Imbolc

</svg>

Daylight is increasing, and the rate of daylight increase is also
increasing. The rate of daylight increase is inversely
proportional to the current amount of daylight, making this time
feel like the bite of winter has given up, but the gloom still
lingers on.

Appreciate the slow return to life. The Hero awakens, and the
world shakes off the stiff wet frost of night.

### Spring

The equinox, when daylight is at its equal point. But far from
being serenely "balanced", it is a time of swift change, as the
rate of change of daylight hits a maximum, and begins to slow.

4/20 occurs near the end of this season, about a week before
Beltane. Relish in delights of the flesh on the solitary
consumptive holiday. Stuff your head with all the beauty nature
can offer.

### Beltane

Daylight is still increasing, but at a reduced pace, as we settle
in towards the bright warm part of the year. The rate of change
of daylight is proportional to the current daylight amount,
making this time feel "more summer than summer", as we head
towards the solstice with increasing anticipation.

A time of growth and waiting. We tend our projects and shephard
them along towards harvest.

Daylight at maximum, and for a brief moment, neither increasing
nor decreasing, as the rate of change flips from positive to
negative.

This is the warmest and brightest time, the days are long and
feel unending. But the year is half over, and the rest will
become progressively darker.

Birthday occurs a few weeks into this season, close to aphelion,
a time for solitary reflection. What have we sown this year? What
will we reap? In ample light of the sun, we take stock of our
selves and our plans.

As aphelion occurs during this season, it is the longest. Truly
Our Lady smiles upon us!

Traditionally, this is the start of the time of harvest. The bulk
of the growing season is past, and the days are still long, but
getting shorter and shorter at an increasing rate.

The rate of change of daylight hours is inversely proportional to
the amount of daylight, making this cross quarter day feel almost
at odds with itself. A warm season that turns a corner and hints
at its own end. The "Sunday" of the year, as the long days drag
on.

The second equinox, this one in the other direction, heading
towards cold dark. The day is balanced with night, but changing
as fast as possible in the direction of shorter days and lower
temperatures.

Traditionally, this reflects the end of the harvest season, time
to pack up what we were able to gather, preserve whatever we can,
and consume whatever we can't.

The dark night approaches. A few weeks after this cross-quarter
day, we celebrate Thanksgiving, the traditional fattening-up
as the long winter nights come.

The days are getting shorter, and the shortness of the days is
proportional to the rate at which they are shortening, creating a
sense that this time is "more winter than winter", as we move
towards the dark solstice at the birth of the next year.

Fae magic is strongest at this time. Be aware!

And that brings us back to Winter, and the year starts over
again.

Placement along the vertical axis reflects the length of the day,
and placement along the horizontal axis reflects the rate at
which the length of the day is changing. As the year progresses,
we move counter-clockwise around the calendar, starting with
Winter at the bottom.

## You can join!

There's nothing crazy you have to do! It costs no money, and
requires no major life changes or ideology. This religion is
simply a practice of mindfulness: an appreciation of the vast and
mysterious world in which we live, with a dash of creative
personification. It is, in many ways, the original human
observance.

Reflect on the coolness of various orbital moments throughout the
year. Notice what is happening with the seasons where you are.

Feel Gravity directly, by separating heavy things from the Earth
on a regular basis. Add the [solar events to your
calendar](https://izs.me/solar-events.ics).

You'll get stronger, and more in touch with the nature all around
you. Petty human grievances seem smaller. And at the end of your
existence, know that the mass of your temporary body will return
to Her eternal embrace.

### Questions

#### Is this a joke?

No. I mean, yes, but only insofar as everything is.

Take it seriously, but do not take the taking seriously
seriously.

#### Is this atheism, polytheism, nihilism, or...?

Yes.

#### Is this a sex cult?

[Depends who's
asking.](https://bsky.app/profile/isaacs.bsky.social/post/3lxftcylsqd2z)

#### What are the moral tenets of this religion?

These will become apparent to you as you practice. Or they won't.
I don't know, I'm not the boss of you.

#### So you just like, work out and chill and be autistic about seasons?

Now you're getting it!
