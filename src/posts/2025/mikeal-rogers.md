[Mikeal Rogers](https://github.com/mikeal) died on the morning of
Monday, 2025-06-09, after enduring 7 months of treatment for
aggressive colorectal cancer.

I'm so inescapably sad.

Last year, Mikeal set up [a git
repository](https://github.com/mikeal/cancer-diaries) and had
asked people to share memories, ways in which they've been
impacted positively.

This is [what I
wrote](https://github.com/mikeal/cancer-diaries/blob/main/best-memories/2024-11-24-just-everything-for-the-last-15-years.md).

Mikeal and I texted back and forth a bit during his treatment.
Mostly, me sending him things, because summoning the energy to
compose a reply was so hard for him by the end.

He said several times that he was looking forward to getting a
meal together again, a nod to those plans abruptly canceled. Just
once the chemo isn't quite so intense. Once he can catch his
breath. Soon.

But it turns out "not gonna make it" was simply the whole truth.
None of us make it, in the end. Death is simultaneously too grand
and cosmic to begin to contemplate, and too petty and pedestrian
to bother commenting on.

"Just everything over the last 15 years" is exactly what I shared
with Mikeal, as our lives developed and priorities shifted. He
and Anna were the first visitors to Marisa's and my first
apartment in Oakland. We went to each other's weddings. Our
conversations stretched over the years and 5 continents. Our kids
grew together and played together. We made time to visit in
between everything else going on, talking each other's ears off
about whatever special interest had our attention at the moment.
From the day we met, it was obvious we'd be friends.

I visited Mikeal on Sunday afternoon, the day before he passed.

He couldn't talk, and was very visibly affected by an
appropriately large amount of pain medication. I told him what an
impact he'd made on my life, and how important our friendship had
been to me, that I would not have been able to do as much in my
life if not for his influence. He nodded and gasped a bit,
attempting to say something perhaps. I hope he understood. But of
course no one can know, and it wouldn't matter now anyway.

There's just nothing for this loss. It sucks so much.
