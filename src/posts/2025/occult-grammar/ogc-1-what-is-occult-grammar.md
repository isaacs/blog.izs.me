All communication, in order to _be_ communication, is governed by
rules that determine the ways in which _utterances_ (that is, any
and all speech acts and their constituent parts, whether verbal
or non-verbal) are assembled by the speaker and listener into
_meaning_. These rules define the
[implicature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicature) carried
by a given speech act, as well as its "literal" meaning.

In this series, I use the term "grammar" to mean those rules that
speakers and listeners use to formulate and interpret speech
acts, body language, actions, and all other "moves" in the
[language
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_philosophy), in
ways that may be to varying degrees _overt_ or _occult_ to those
participating in the communication. Using this framework, I will
discuss various ways that the divergence between grammars can
create conversational obstacles between speakers of allistic and
autistic neurotypes, and approaches for overcoming said
obstacles.

## Occult vs Overt Grammar

Rules of grammar may be, to varying degrees, _overt_, that is,
known and recognized by the language participants, or _occult_,
hidden from their view. Grammar rules can be made overt by
careful observation, but quite often, those fluent in a language
find it disconcerting to notice that they've been following a
rule for many years in countless conversations without ever
recognizing its existence.

When a child first learns to speak, all grammar is occult to
them. Over time, they come to understand that utterances are
composed of discrete components. Some of these identify actions,
others identify things, still others describe shape or color or
direction, and so on. From their interactions with others, they
form an implicit understanding of these rules long before they go
to school and learn words like "verb" and "noun".

Some rules, like the assembly of simple parts of speech, are
straightforward to discover and make overt. Others are less so.

For example, native English speakers somehow know that "good
little dog" sounds more correct than "little good dog", because
[size comes _after_
opinion](https://sketchplanations.com/ordering-adjectives). But,
"big bad wolf" is correct, despite violating this rule, because
adjective order is superseded by [ablaut
reduplication](https://sketchplanations.com/ablaut-reduplication).
When forming utterances, we follow these complicated overlapping
rules without even knowing them consciously.

Consider also, "a hot little flame" implies that a singular "hot
flame" is small in size. However, "a little hot flame" carries the
connotation that the "hot flame" is a _stuff_, which we have a
small _quantity_ of. This is because the characteristic "hot"
must come _before_ the description of size of a single object,
but _after_ quantity of some mass noun.

In this example, we observe how occult grammar rules also
determine how we _interpret_ language, switching "flame" from a
countable to a mass noun. That is, the sense of "little" being
either about size or about amount, is determined by the occult
grammar rule of adjective order.<sup
id="occult-grammar-p1-1-back">[1](#occult-grammar-p1-1)</sup>

If you ask a speaker to explain these rules, most people will
struggle. We know the rule implicitly, and can follow it
flawlessly, but we don't know _how_ we know it. And yet, the
rules inexorably determine how we interpret moves in the language
game. We cannot help it.

"Occult grammar" refers to the hidden rules of communication that
native speakers of a language use without conscious awareness.
The rules are "occult" in the sense that they are hidden from
view, _especially_ from the view of those who clearly understand
the grammar well enough to use it flawlessly.

These rules are simply _how the language works_. It's not
necessary to enforce them, because fluency in the language
_means_ following them. They are natural laws of interpretation
and expression, rather than social rules of decorum. As such,
they do not need enforcement; they just exist to be discovered
through observation.

## More Than Words

In this series, I am referring to human communication in the
broadest possible sense, and thus "grammar" concerns more than
merely the assembly of words; that is, I use the term "utterance"
in the sense of "a move in the [language
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_philosophy)"
rather than strictly a spoken or written series of words.

Of course, much of human communication _is_ carried by the
creation and interpretation of words. But the principles here
should equally be applied to things such as a sigh, a wave, a
cough, entering or exiting a room, giving a gift, sending an
invitation, turning to face towards or away from someone,
tightening the muscles of the lips or eyelids, making or breaking
eye contact, and so on. These things can be considered
"linguistic", despite not being strictly "verbal", at least when
humans do them.<sup
id="occult-grammar-p1-2-back">[2](#occult-grammar-p1-2)</sup>

Perhaps the most fundamental rule of grammar in almost any human
communication is the [cooperative
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle),
which is the framework underlying theories of language such as
[relevance
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory) and
[Grice's
Maxims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle#Grice's_maxims).

However, even if we accept that all language ought to follow the
cooperative principle, and provide some relevant information
sufficient to justify the listener attending to it, the question
remains of _what_ sorts of things we ought to consider
"relevant", what objective we are cooperating _towards_. Similar
to how ablaut reduplication supersedes adjective order ("good
little dog" but "big bad wolf"), there are cases where occult
grammar rules may supersede or alter our understanding of the
less buried rules of cooperative relevance.

Humans are social beings, and as a result, communication forms a
significant part of our cognition. Grammar is the underlying
framework of communication, despite often being largely hidden
from conscious awareness. Thus, rather than assume that all
communicators implement the same rules of grammar, it is more
fruitful to examine them in action.

## Occult Grammar and Culture

While some aspects of human communication are no doubt
universal, language is both essential to culture and extremely
dependent upon it. Even between cultures that ostensibly speak
the "same" language, there may be extreme differences in the ways
that certain speech acts are interpreted. Often, this is a result
of cultural ideas about the importance, costs, and benefits of
various sorts of interaction.

Consider for example the clash between [ask cultures and guess
cultures](https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421).

Within an "ask" culture, denying a request is seen as essentially
a zero-cost interaction. Ask cultures place a high value on
freedom, independence, and clarity, also known as ["negative
face"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness_theory). While
gifts may be given, it's understood that a gift might miss the
mark. Thus, gifts confer little to no obligation on the part of
the receiver, and it's often better to assume someone doesn't
want help if they haven't asked for it. You ask for what you
want, you might get a "no", and that's fine. If someone hasn't
asked, it's safe to assume they don't want something. If someone
asks for something you don't want to give, you can say "no" and
neither has lost any social capital.

Within a "guess" culture, on the other hand, "positive face" is
given higher importance, and denying a request is seen as
a personal rejection. Therefore, it's very important to try to
_avoid_ situations that might result in someone having to turn
down a request, as they are unlikely to do so, even if meeting
the request breeds resentment. Guess cultures place a high
priority on social cohesion. A guess culture adherent would only
explicitly ask for something if their numerous hints had gone
unnoticed, or perhaps if it was a dire emergency, because asking
puts the recipient in the awkward position of perhaps having to
turn down the request, which could cause conflict.

Even though both parties might be native English speakers, a
person from an ask culture person and another from a guess
culture will approach social interactions with a different occult
grammar of communication. The ask culture adherent will seem pushy
and demanding, whereas the guess culture adherent will seem
passive-aggressive and inscrutable. When they attempt to explain
themselves to one another, the confusion will only tend to
deepen, because though they are using the same words, their
contexts may be completely incompatible.

## Neurotypal Communication Grammars

Grammars form the "operating system" of our communicative
machinery. They determine the assumptions and implicit context
that are used to form and interpret every speech act. In fact,
they even help establish what _is_ a "speech act" and what is
just some other kind of thing. For example, is that person waving
at me? Or are they just stretching their arm or doing some kind
of dance? (And are they dancing for me? About me? _At_ me?<sup
id="occult-grammar-p1-3-back">[3](#occult-grammar-p1-3)</sup>)

People whose neurotypes diverge from societal neuronormativity
can have radically different relationships with language, due to
having different occult grammar rules.

Being autistic in an allistic society often feels like a strange
sort of culture shock; I'm from here, I speak this language, and
yet whenever I speak to the people around me, we seem to talk
past one another and leave in confusion.

This [double empathy
problem](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy)
arises largely from differences in the occult grammar rules used
by allistic and autistic people in their communication. By
studying and consciously considering these rules, even as they
seem strange and foreign to us, we can improve our communication.
Even more beneficially, by identifying the differences, autistic
people can more effectively advocate for the benefits of our
natural communication style.

It seems likely to me, though I of course have no direct
knowledge, that other divergent neurotypes may also have
different occult grammars of their own, especially those such as
Cluster A and B Personality Disorders, which involve
social/emotional divergence from the societal norm.

However, the divergence between autistic and allistic norms are
so significant that they appear to comprise a signficant majority
of the "social deficits" associated with ASD. We simply do not
interpret or formulate utterances according to the same rules as
the allistic majority. And when asked, the allistic people in our
life genuinely cannot explain what those rules even are. Both
sides are left waving their hands in exasperation at the other's
obstinate inscrutability.

It is clear upon investigation that the divergence between
allistic occult grammar and autistic occult grammar are at least
as significant as any other cultural divide, and should be
treated with the same level of cultural sensitivity.

## Coming Next

This framework has remarkable explanatory power which can be
leveraged powerfully in service of mutual empathy, understanding,
and collaboration.

In the next posts in this series, I will discuss some of the
specific rules of the occult grammars of
[allistic](/p/ogc-2-allistic) and [autistic](/p/ogc-3-autistic)
communication, and the [conflicts that arise from their
differences](/p/ogc-4-conflict).

<span id="occult-grammar-p1-1">1: Truly, adjective order in
English is so deeply weird and occult as to be downright spooky.
I'm not sure that anyone has really cataloged all of the edge
cases and dialectal variants, or if such a project is even
possible, but I somehow just know when it's wrong, as surely as
if there was a hair in my eye. <a

<span id="occult-grammar-p1-2">2: A reasonable objection here is
that such things may often be more properly characterized as body
language or some other sort of non-linguistic communication, of
the sort that many nonhuman animals do, despite not having
"language" or "grammar" per se. However, when discussing the
behavior of _humans_, which _are_ extremely language-using, such
gestures take on culturally-specific connotations, and exhibit
both discreteness and displacement, key indicators that separate
language from other non-linguistic forms of communication. <a
