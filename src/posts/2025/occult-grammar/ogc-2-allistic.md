As discussed in [part 1](/p/ogc-1-what-is-occult-grammar), an
"Occult Grammar" is a set of rules that govern the [language
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_philosophy),
yet which remain hidden to participants in that communication.

Thus, occult grammar isn't a set of rules that need enforcement;
each person just feels them implicitly. They are the _hidden_
implicit natural laws that make the language game what it is.

## Allistic vs Autistic Communication

As an autistic person, it often feels like communication between
allistic people relies on a set of rules that everyone seems to
Just Know, but no one can explain or articulate, let alone
justify. Nonetheless, our language acts are interpreted according
to this grammar, often resulting in
[miscommunication](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy)
that is frustrating for all parties.

In discussion with therapists and [other autistic
thinkers](https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1la1s1n/4_rules_of_allistic_communication/),
what follows is a concise list of the most relevant occult
grammar rules that govern allistic communication.

Note that, much like [ablaut
reduplication](https://sketchplanations.com/ablaut-reduplication)
or [adjective
order](https://sketchplanations.com/ordering-adjectives), people
who follow these rules typically _aren't_ fully conscious of
them. Certainly there are exceptions, and situations where an
allistic person might be exhibiting more or less neuroticism in
how these rules are applied, depending on their current levels of
social threat, rapport, security, and so on.

Also, as the dominant majority neurotype in every human society
and even most niche communities, allistic communication norms
tend to be _the_ communication norms. Autists are generally
expected to conform to them, and there is a strong incentive to
habituate to them as much as possible. As a result, whether
through socialization or self-training, many autists do come to
internalize some or all of these rules.

However, as they are largely invisible to those who find them
easy to instinctively follow, it can be challenging to learn what
these rules even are!

## The Occult Grammar Rules

1. No unmotivated utterances.
2. All motivations regard social status.
3. No negations.
4. Speaking a name invokes its vibes.

## 1. No unmotivated utterances.

Every communication act, whether actual spoken words, or
movements of your body, even how one _breathes_, is presumed to
be indicative of a specific _motivation_. All speech acts are
attempts to not just convey information but _accomplish a goal_
beyond the semantic content of the communication itself.

Of course, "convey information" is technically a "goal", but this
rule implies _additional_ motivation beyond what is explicitly a
part of the utterance itself. I use "motivated" here in the sense
of "[motivated
reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning)", a
motivation _apart from_ the content of the utterance itself.

When the motivation of an utterance is not clear to them, allists
tend to become distracted, anxious, and suspicious, as they
struggle to interpret hidden meaning. If you simply want to share
information with the hopes that they might enjoy knowing it, or
which might assist them in some task they are doing, many will
interpret this as condescending and rude.

## 2. All motivations regard social status.

All motivations behind utterances are presumed to be related to
_social status_. As in, the ultimate goal is to increase one's
social leverage, to gain power and influence over others, evade a
status threat from a higher status member of the group, establish
alliances and boundaries as part of this social game, and so on.

Any proximate motivations that are _not_ regarding social status,
are in service of hidden goals that do serve social status.

This does not imply malice! Many motivations that regard social
status are designed to increase _another's_ social status, so as
to put them at ease, build rapport, and establish mutual benefit.
However, if someone is appearing to obscure or hide their status
related motivations (the only logical conclusion if a motivation
cannot be determined; see Rule 1), then there's a good chance
they are trying to get away with something nefarious, and others
will likely react with suspicion.

Thus, it's best to establish and state a clear and reasonably
self-interested social-status-related motivation up front, so
that the allists you communicate with can relax and understand
how to manage you.

For example, you could start a conversation with something like
"I am interested in improving our relationship so that you can
help me in my career, so I would appreciate the opportunity to
buy you lunch." If you simply offer to pay without providing such
a motivation, it may be seen as manipulative; yet if the
"manipulation" is made clear, so that the participant knows what
they are consenting to, then it's much more comfortable for them.

## 3. No negations.

If you say "I'm not angry at you", an allistic recipient will
likely receive something like "I'm anger about you!" and get
concerned about your anger at them.

It's not that they're lying or being intentionally
hypersensitive; the negation _simply does not exist_ in most
allistic communication. They do not hear it. When speaking with
allistics, be sure to always use statements phrased in a
logically positive manner. Avoid words like "not", "never", and
so on.

Of course, if an allistic person asks you "Are you going to the
party?" and you say "no", it's not as if they simply won't hear
what you said. They _are_ obviously capable of registering
negation as such. But when mixed into the context of a more
complicated thought, the negation vanishes, and what's left is
the _emotional valence_ of the rest of the sentence.

One interesting impact of this is the exuberant double-negative
that some languages feature, to express a _positive_ statement in
a coy manner. For example, "I'm not _not_ into it!" to imply that
you are in fact into something, but wish to self-deprecatingly
call attention to possible social cost of admitting as much. In
following rules 1 and 2, this also signals a self-effacing offer
of social status to the recipient of the message, and provides a
bid for them to validate your feelings, which establishes a
social status alliance.

## 4. Speaking a name invokes its vibes.

We sometimes refer to this as "naming h₂ŕ̥tḱos", referencing the
fact that many languages in the Proto-Indo-European family lost
the original word for "bear", likely a linguistic taboo based on
the belief that saying the name of a thing would summon it. (For
example, "bear" derives from a Proto-Germanic word for "brown".)

Along with Rule 3, this means that saying something like "I did
not get in a car accident" might cause someone to become very
alarmed and concerned, as if they witnessed a car accident. As
all utterances are motivated, and all motivations regard social
status, this may leave the allist believing that you are
attempting to garner sympathy in order to have power over them.

Thus, it's important to be mindful of the emotional "vibes" of
the words you use.

As allistic people tend to have [remarkably similar senses
of what is near-mode vs
far-mode](/2024/02/near-mode-far-mode-autism/), this is rarely a
problem for them. However, autists run the risk of inadvertently
triggering near- or far-mode without realizing it, throwing off
their audience's processing ability.

## No Privileged Neurotypes! (except neurotypicality typically is)

There is a tendency in discussions of allistic communication for
autistic people to react with indignation and surprise at
learning what seems like arcane, convoluted, and illogical rules
of social status. "Why can't they just _say what they mean!?_" the
autist cries.

But, _they are saying what they mean_. The meaning of words is
determined not by a dictionary, but by the pragmatics of
participants in the communication act. That there are _different_
styles of communication, governed by different rules of grammar,
is simply reflective of the diversity of the human experience.
None of these are inherently better or worse than another, even
though some might be more suited to certain situations or
environments than others, just as we might find with different
languages or modalities.

We autists can _and should_ learn these occult grammar rules, and
apply them in the communication we do with allistic people. We
should be the change we wish to see in the world, and be generous
in the communication support needs of others.

However, we equally are within our rights to demand that _our_
communication styles are respected as well. We are more able to
do that if we advocate for ourselves in terms that our audience
will readily understand. Even as we may not accept the
_rightness_ of one neurotype being dominant, we must accept the
_actual fact_ that it is, if we are to survive and thrive in the
real world.

## Coming Next

In the next posts in this series, I will discuss the occult
[grammar rules that govern _autistic_
communication](/p/ogc-3-autistic), and some of the conflicts that
arise from the translation challenges.
