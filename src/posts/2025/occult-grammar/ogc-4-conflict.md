The [Double Empathy
Problem](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy)
describes the way that two people of different neurotypes are
likely to misunderstand one another. It highlights the observable
truth that autistic people do not, in fact, "lack empathy", but
rather they _lack empathy for allistic people they cannot
understand_, and that allistic people exhibit the _same_ lack of
empathy for autistic people.

Studies have shown that this breakdown is in fact _not_ typically
due to autistic cognitive shortcomings, but rather a lack of
reciprocity that _all_ humans exhibit towards those who are
unlike them. The critical difference, and the reason why it
appears to allistic people that autists have a social deficit, is
that autists are simply a minority.

Variances in occult communication grammars play a major factor in
this lack of reciprocity.

Let's go through the identified rules of
[allistic](/p/ogc-2-allistic) versus
[autistic](/p/ogc-3-autistic) communication, and see where they
lead our conversations astray.

Remember, neither is better or worse than the other. Autistic
communication is _my_ style, so of course I find it more natural.
And allistic communication is more _common_, simply because the
vast majority of people are not autistic.

But _all_ human communication is a series of moves in a language
game defined by the players. It is interesting to examine and
study the games, but we should not delude ourselves into
believing that there is any objectively "correct" way to
communicate, apart from what works for the communicators.

## Comparing the Rulesets

1. Motivation

    **Autistic: Motivations are explicit.**

    **Allistic: No unmotivated utterances.**

2. Status and Care

    **Autistic: Correct knowledge is everyone's responsibility.**

    **Allistic: All motivations regard social status.**

3. Grammar and Assembly


    **Autistic: Grammar is relevant.**

    **Allistic: No negations.**

4. Meaning

    **Autistic: Symbols carry their assigned meaning.**

    **Allistic: Speaking a name invokes its vibes.**

## Motivations

In allistic communication, every utterance is presumed to be
indicative of a motivation _apart from that contained by the
speech act itself_. In autistic communication, the motivation of
any speech act is assumed to be explicitly visible in the
utterance itself.

This leads to conflict both because allistic people infer
motivations that do not exist (or become troubled and confused
when they fail to find such motivations), _and also_ because
autists both fail to infer motivations that allistics intend to
communicate, and inadvertently communicate motivations that are
inaccurate.

As an autistic person, one of the most perplexing conflicts is
when someone asks a reasonable question, which you answer
plainly, and they get upset, saying "Do you _really_ think that's
what I wanted to know?" as if you've called them stupid.

A close second is when I want to request or convey some piece of
information, and my allistic conversation partner seemingly
cannot avoid engaging in completely unrelated things. "What time
are we leaving?" invites the answer "If you need to get there
sooner, we can go earlier", which was _not the question!_ The
more I try to clarify that I just want the information, they more
they assure me that any time I want to leave is fine, if I'm in
such a hurry, we can leave right now, jeez!

The exasperated display (jeez!) is a reaction to a perceived
status attack. By asking when we're leaving, I'm _calling
attention to the time of departure_, which is taken as an
indication that I want to leave soon. By rejecting the assurance
that my desire will be respected, I'm rejecting a social bid for
alliance.

Because allistic communicators are typically all engaged in
largely the same manner with the social status hierarchy of a
given situation, they are all likely to make the same assumptions
about the social motivations of any given utterance, provided
that they are part of the same social group hierarchy.

However, if your baselevel assumption is that we use words that
mean things, to send the message that we intend, then a question
like ["is there a difference between the drinks in the living
room, and the drinks in the
refrigerator"](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8AcCbtp/) is completely
baffling. Even if I am mindful to consider pragmatics, it's just
an impossibly convoluted riddle unless we start from the
assumption that _everything_ is regarding status, deference, and
hierarchy.

## Status and Care

Allistic communication is a nearly constant exchange of status,
to show that the speaker is or isn't a threat to the other's
status, to suss out who is higher status than the other and thus
must be deferred to, to establish the many varied layers of group
affiliations and rivalries between parties, and so on.

On the other hand, autistic people tend to be far less concerned
with social status than allistic people. We are largely
_oblivious_ to it.

Sometimes this works to our benefit! After all, "unaware of
social status" can be a great way to signal confidence and
security within allistic circles, which can come across as
a person who is powerful and safe.

However, far _more_ often, this backfires, as rules of deference
are dependent on social hierarchy context.

When an autist speaks up to correct a mistake, it is often taken
as an attack. We are upsetting the social order by engaging in
"one-upsmanship" or "well, actualyism". These are often fair
cricitisms; there are cases were getting the high level picture
in place is more important than everyone agreeing on all the
details.

This is the origin of the "You just always have to be right!"
complaint that so many autists hear repeatedly throughout our
lives.

From the autistic point of view, I need us _all_ to always be
right, isn't that the point? Do you want us to be _wrong_?

But from the allistic point of view, the social status of being
"the one who is right" is far more relevant than the truth value
of any particular statement, and insisting on correcting mistakes
strikes them as a grab at unearned status, rather than the
status-neutral act of care and consideration.

## Assigned Meaning, Grammar, and Assembly

In autistic communication, symbols carry the meaning that they
are assigned, either for use within a specific context (for
example, jargon or techical terms) or more broadly, using a
conventional definition. These meanings can be negated, flipped
around, or assembled, according to fairly well defined
grammatical rules that make up the language.

Allistic communication is much more top-down. A word may pick up
a specific connotation or strong emotional valence, and will
"invoke" that emotional context when it is used, _regardless of
any negation or reassignment_ that might be applied!

For example, imagine if you worked at an office job, and a
colleague came to you saying that they were frustrated by the way
that the team was filing documents. In the course of trying to
gain clarity about their request, you say "So, just to make sure
I understand your complaint--"

At which point, they cut you off, slightly raising their voice
and becoming visibly irate, and say "I'm not **COMPLAINING**, I'm
just saying we need to do it **DIFFERENTLY**!"

This is, of course, extremely confusing. By definition, a
"complaint" is literally just a statement of a thing that one
would prefer to be other than what it is.

What might be going on?

- They are coming to you with a need. This puts them in a
  vulnerable position, because their social status needs to be
  high enough to be granted this request, and can take a hit if
  it is not.
- You are trying to remain calm and listen respectfully. However,
  because you're not immediately validating their threatened
  status, it seems like you are positioning yourself as an
  authority of _higher_ status, likely to deliver a social
  injury.
- You use the word "complaint", which has the _emotional
  connotation_ of a petulant, childish, "entitled" person, who
  does not deserve whatever it is they are asking for.

And so, they lose it, and lash out in fear at the perceived
social attack.

## Top Down, Bottom Up

This post could be an entire book, if I attempted to catalog
every communication challenge that autistic people face with
agonizing regularity. As I'm too lazy for that task, I'll leave
it as an exercise for the reader to apply this model to their
future conversations, in the hopes that it can be illuminating.

What emerges from the comparison of these rules and a few common
miscommunication patterns, is reflective of [top-down versus
bottom-up
approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom-up_and_top-down_approaches).
For the autistic communicator, communication follows a more or
less predictable bottom-up script:

1. Mentally identify an observation, a piece of information
   that needs to be shared, a playful reference that's relevant
   to the situation, whatever. Something that we would benefit by
   communicating.
2. Assemble an utterance in your language, out of words that
   combine to mean that thing you're trying to communicate it.
3. Say the thing.
4. The listener interprets the word, and now knows the thing,
   gets the joke, is aware of the observation, whatever.

However, allistic communication moves in a more top-down
wholistic manner:

1. Awareness of social status, and a desire to take some action
   regarding that status. (Establish a rapport, trounce a rival,
   assist an ally, evade a threat, etc.)
2. Identify key concepts vaguely in the area of the intended
   message.
3. Make small communication moves, checking in on the response
   of the recipient to ensure the intended emotional target is
   reached, and adjusting as needed.

It is not quite accurate to say that one is more or less
"precise" than the other, but autistic communication starts from
the individual "atoms" of utterances, and assembles them
linguistically, whereas allistic communication tends to start
from the emotional intent, and makes small moves to continually
adjust in that direction.

That is, autistic communication is based on a _bottom-up_ model
of assembling meaningful tokens into utterances to precisely
express communicative intent about a shared reality, whereas
allistic communication is a _top-down_ model of assuming that
everyone's main fixation is social status and using topic
keywords to collaboratively gesture towards a shared social
equilibrium.

## Differences in Collaboration

This top-down/bottom-up divergence also sheds light on the
differences in collaborative meaning-making and discovery between
allistic and autistic communicators.

Many allists "think out loud", in conversation with another
participant. In a top-down fashion, they might throw out a
general "direction" concept, as an invitation for their
communication partner to help them refine it towards clarity.
That is, doing the same sort of "cast, then iterate" approach,
but collaboratively.

Autists tend to be more bottom-up in our thinking, and this
reflects in our communication as "speaking in paragraphs". That
is, by the time the thought is ready for sharing, it's a
construction with interlocking parts. We do want feedback! But
feedback on a part of the building without seeing the whole, is
unlikely to be useful.

So, there is an allistic person seeking feedback, and becoming
frustrated by not getting engagement, while the autistic person
is attempting to respectfully listen until they understand the
message. In allistic terms this looks like a refusal to
participate, "waiting to respond", which can be hostile and
threatening, as it does not acknowledge or reinforce the social
dynamic and connection. All the moreso because when they _do_
respond, it's often to point out errors (correctness is
everyone's responsibility), rather than just getting the
intention.

Then when the autistic person speaks, they can get frustrated to
meltdown by repeated interruptions that keep taking them off the
topic at hand, which in allistic terms, appears to be an
aggressive "holding the floor" approach to speaking.

Both parties are attempting to collaborate in the way that they
know how, but these differences in approaches to meaning and
understanding can often present significant obstacles without
deliberate structured communication techniques.

## Calls to Action

This series attempts to identify and examine a model of how
inter-neurotype communication fails, viewed through a lens of
cultural subjectivity. I have endeavored to not assign blame or
imply that either linguistic reasoning approach is better or
worse than the other.

The question of _responsibility_ for correcting communication
gaps, however, is more interesting. All too often, it falls on
the disadvantaged group to do the work of addressing the
challenges they face, especially if that disadvantaged group is a
minority in society. Those in a position of privilege do not feel
the pain of the oppression they benefit from, and thus any
request for accommodations can feel like oppression.

It is reasonable for autistic people to use this model to gain a
deeper understanding of the communication challenges we face,
including the ways in which allistic people will _always_ fail to
understand us. It is often a matter of survival for us to be able
to manipulate their emotions and understand their self-delusions
in order to simply be allowed to exist in the world. Sadly, they
will usually not be willing or able to see this themselves.

While I do not believe we can expect to be met halfway, using the
language of allistic communication to express our needs as
autistic communicators can be quite effective. Hopefully the
information in this series is useful, if only as a way to
understand the confusing messages of a world where we are
perpetual foreigners.

From [part 2 in this series](/p/ogc-2-allistic):

> However, we equally are within our rights to demand that _our_

So this raises the obvious question, how can one demand this, in
the language of the allistic majority?

- Establish a shared goal of collaboration.
- Position ourself as the one in need, who is making a request.
  This boosts the social status of the allistic participant by
  allowing them to see themselves as the empowered party who
  deigns to stoop to our level.
- Speak in strictly positive requests and observations. Instead
  of telling them what to avoid, tell them what to _do_, and why
  it's helpful. Besides simply being less cognitive load by
  making positive requests, it also avoids the pitfalls of
  appearing critical.
- Avoid words with connotations implying disability, entitlement,
  or other "justifications" of your needs. Instead, focus on
  gratitude and _positive_ impacts of the accommodations being
  requested.
- Identify the subject from a top-down direction, refining
  precision and checking in _more frequently than seems
  necessary_ regarding emotional valence and understanding.

This is, of course, quite a lot of work, and it is emotional
labor that frequently goes unrecognized. It is thus responsible
to only engage in this degree of "neurotype translation" for the
relationships and conversations that are most important, where
[masking](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/masking)
carries the highest mental health costs.

For other scenarios, it can at least be useful to help understand
what's going on, even if there's little we can reasonably do to
fix the situation.

## Further Discussion and Investigation

I would love to hear from you if you find this model useful, or
if you have anything to add to it.
