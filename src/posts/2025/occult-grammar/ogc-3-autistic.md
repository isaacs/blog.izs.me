Part of a series on the Occult Grammar of Communication

- [Part 2: Allistic Communication](/p/ogc-2-allistic)
- Part 3: Autistic Communication

</div>

In [Part 1](/p/ogc-1-what-is-occult-grammar), I discussed the
nature of occult grammars, and how they invisibly affect
communication both in composition and interpretation of
communication acts, as well as determining which things count
_as_ communication acts.

In [Part 2](/p/ogc-2-allistic), I discussed four fundamental
rules of allistic occult grammar, approaching the subject based
on observation as an outsider to allistic communication, who
nevertheless must live within a predominantly allistic society.

In this part, I will attempt to do the same for autistic occult
grammar. Please accept my apology for the following tedious
disclaimers.

## Tedious Disclaimers

As someone who is autistic, I am perhaps _least_ able to identify
the grammar that is implicit and hidden in autistic
communication. Nonetheless, these seem like a good start.
Feedback on this subject is welcome, via any of the contact links
at the top of this page.

The approach here is to examine the allistic occult grammar
rules, and back into them via more or less symmetrical phrasings
that highlight the reasons why those rules might strike an
autistic person as strange.

Just to reiterate, these might seem obviously true to autistic
people (or obviously false to allists!), perhaps even like
something that doesn't need to be stated explicitly. _That is
precisely the point!_ Occult grammars appear to us as just "the
way things are, the only way they can be", rather than a rule
that has to be stated explicitly.

Again, no positive or negative judgement is intended in any of
these descriptions. It may be that my own personal bias comes
across, though I have endeavored to be as fair as possible. If it
seems like one or the other set is getting more generous
treatment, consider that it might simply be more natural to your
neurotype.

Lastly, remember that autism is not a monolith, and neither is
autistic culture. As the saying goes, "If you've meet one
autistic person, you've met them." Since I am working from the
disadvantage of closeness, as if a fish attempted to describe
water, it's very possible that these occult grammar rules are
further occluded by other cultural biases.

But enough disclaiming!

## The Occult Grammar Rules

1. Motivations are explicit.
2. Correct knowledge is everyone's responsibility.
3. Grammar is relevant.
4. Symbols carry their assigned meaning.

## 1. Motivations are explicit.

The primary motivation of any utterances is explicit in the
utterance itself. If someone says "When are we leaving for the
party?" it's because _they want to know when we are leaving for
the party_, not because they have a desire to leave sooner or
later than otherwise would've happened if they hadn't asked.

This certainly does not preclude jokes, sarcasm, and other forms
of linguistic play! In fact, many autists are hyperlexic and
_nearly constantly_ engage various forms of wordplay, and delight
in oblique references and layered meanings. However, a pun or a
joke _is just what it is_. The utterance _in itself_ is not
typically a tool to effect some other kind of communication
outcome _beyond_ the play that the autist is engaged in.

## 2. Correct knowledge is everyone's responsibility.

It is everyone's shared responsibility to work together to
notice, identify, and correct any mistakes. If it seems that one
party has information that the other lacks, then the kind and
polite thing to do is to share that information.

While some social status may be conferred by being the sort of
person who readily shares information, that is not the
motivation. It is simply the duty of information-havers to share
the information that they have. No harm is done by sharing
information. Correction is an act of _care_.

This can at times become a distraction from communication
pragmatics. However, it is important in autistic communication to
ensure that the correct words are being used to communicate the
intended information, so that an even more distracting
miscommunication can be avoided.

## 3. Grammar is relevant.

The sentence "I am not going to set the car on fire" is not a
threat. In fact, it is the _opposite_ of a threat.

In addition to meaning being carried by "topic" words, like "car"
and "fire", the _other_ words in a sentence are just as important
to interpreting the overall message, such as "not".

Not only do negations exist, they are always relevant, and fully
negate or reverse the emotional valence of a statement. As
[bottom-up
thinkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom-up_and_top-down_approaches),
we construct meaning based on the constituent parts of an
utterance and the rules of their assembly; we do not start from
vague high-level impressions and make assumptions about the
parts.

## 4. Symbols carry their assigned meaning.

All utterances are seen as moves in a largely arbitrary language
game, where symbols (words, gestures, etc.) carry the meaning
that they are assigned by the players in the game.

In many contexts, it is possible to redefine words, and this is
often done as needed, especially when the conventional meaning of
a word may be vague or imprecise. Autists will often pause a
discussion to indicate something like "Ok, by _this_ I mean,
_such and such_, but if I'm referring to _that_, I'll use this
other term instead." From that point on, whatever _conventional_
definition the word might've meant, it acquires a more precise
meaning local to the current conversation.

While some topics may carry [near- or
far-mode](/2024/02/near-mode-far-mode-autism/) connotations,
these will likely be different for each autistic speaker. As
it's impossible to predict, it is reasonable for each
participant to manage their reactions on their own.

## Literal Thinking, Pedantic Vocabulary, and Infodumping

If being correct is our shared responsibility as communicators,
and if the grammar and tokens of a language act can be reliably
assembled to convey a specific statement as unambiguously as
possible, and we can usually pause and clarify or refine
definitions as needed, then it's clear how the stereotypical
"autistic" mode of communication arises.

It's _good, actually,_ to interrupt a speaker to point out that
they misspoke, or clarify specifically which sense of a word they
mean. Just as it is good to _be interrupted_ for this reason! It
shows interest, which is an essential part of ensuring that
information can be reliably and efficiently shared.

The autistic pattern of expounding at length on a topic of
personal interest, aka
[infodumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infodumping), also
arises from these occult grammar rules. If an autistic person
knows a lot about a subject, then they have a social obligation
to share that information.

In many autistic spaces online and in meatspace, these
communication norms can emerge organically and result in very
productive and pleasant interactions between autistic people (and
allists who have learned to participate in the autistic mode of
communication).

However, when viewed through the lens of [_allistic_
communication norms](/p/ogc-2-allistic), these conversations can
appear to be a relentless assault of posturing, dominance,
combative interruption, nitpicking of minutiae, and a stubborn
refusal to provide even the most basic human care for one
another.

## Coming Next

In the final part of this series, I will discuss how the [Double
Empathy
Problem](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/professional-practice/double-empathy)
arises from these differences in culture, and ways that these
occult rules of message creation and interpretation can be
overtly leveraged for better communication outcomes.
