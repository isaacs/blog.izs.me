<p>In the time that I&rsquo;ve been a LinkedIn user, 100% of the messages that
I&rsquo;ve got from the service have been one of the following types:</p>

<ol><li>[person you met once] did [some random pointless thing] on LinkedIn</li>
<li>Recruiter Spam</li>
</ol><p>I had 265 connections, all of whom were people I&rsquo;d actually met and
interacted with in some professional capacity.  But I never once
interacted with any of them in any meaningful way on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Today, I realized that the worst Manager, the worst Ops engineer, and
the worst programmer that I&rsquo;d ever worked with (three separate people)
all have several glowing recommendations on their profile.</p>

<p>In order for evil to triumph, all that must happen is for good men to do
nothing.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going to hire me, it&rsquo;s going to be because you already know my work.  If I&rsquo;m going to hire you, it&rsquo;s going to be for the same reason.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll see you on the internets.</p>
