<p>By now, if you haven&rsquo;t heard the outrage at the TSA&rsquo;s &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; pat-down procedures, then you don&rsquo;t use the internet, and you&rsquo;re not reading this blog.</p>

<p>They <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tsa+groping+children">grope children</a>.  They <a href="http://johnnyedge.blogspot.com/2010/11/these-events-took-place-roughly-between.html">touch your junk</a>.  The procedures are <a href="http://www.thestar.com/iphone/news/world/article/744199---israelification-high-security-little-bother">ludicrously ineffective and harmful from a security point of view</a>.  And the naked-picture xray machines <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/35498347/UCSF-letter-to-Holdren-concerning-health-risks-of-full-body-scanner-TSA-screenings-4-6-2010">are most likely unsafe</a>.</p>

<p>Things like this get me feeling all rebellious and Jeffersonian.  So, since I&rsquo;m flying up to <a href="http://joyent.com">Joyent&rsquo;s</a> Vancouver offices today, I decided to do a little prep work.</p>

<p>First, I took the UCSF letter, added a bit of highlighting and annotation to make it a bit easier to scan, and printed it out.  You can get a copy from <a href="http://j.mp/cancer-ray.">http://j.mp/cancer-ray.</a></p>

<p>I was worried that I&rsquo;d chicken out.  No, not &ldquo;worried&rdquo;.  I was <em>sure</em> I&rsquo;d chicken out. Of <em>course</em> I would.  I talk a good game about incendiary politics and unconventional ideals, but when the chips are down, I generally do the expedient thing like a nice polite citizen.  I&rsquo;m not one of these &ldquo;talk down the authorities&rdquo; types, even though I wish I was.</p>

<p>But then my flight was cancelled, and I learned that I&rsquo;d have to be in the airport until 12 to catch the next one.  The extra time to kill strengthened my resolve.  &ldquo;So what if I&rsquo;m detained?,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to be anywhere for 5 more hours.&rdquo;  Plus I was alone, so there wasn&rsquo;t anyone else&rsquo;s embarrassment to worry about.  I repeated the confidence mantras in my head.  They&rsquo;re expendable workers.  I own this place.  I&rsquo;m the boss.  They work for me.  The only reason I don&rsquo;t fire them is that they&rsquo;re cheaper than robots.  Etc.</p>

<p>I started talking to the family behind me as soon as I got into the security line, a middle-aged couple with 2 adolescent boys and a girl about 4 or 5.  They were amused by <a href="http://www.vibrams.co.uk/">my shoes</a>, so it wasn&rsquo;t too hard to strike up a conversation.</p>

<p>I asked where they were from.  Santa Clara.  Heading to Toronto for some family thing.  I asked if they&rsquo;d heard about the new X-Ray machines.  The dad was tired and apathetic. She said, &ldquo;Oh, yeah, I heard about those on the news, that if you don&rsquo;t go through, they grope you or something, and if you do, they take a naked picture of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s messed up.  Did you know that the UCSF oncology department thinks they pose a serious health risk, especially to children or anyone at risk for breast cancer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa, no, I didn&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I handed the paper to the mom.  Bam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, honey, you should read this!! &hellip; Oh my god&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turns out she&rsquo;s a breast cancer survivor.  And her doctor has told her to avoid x-rays, even at the dentist, unless absolutely medically necessary.  And she didn&rsquo;t realize that &ldquo;millimeter wave digital backscatter detection&rdquo; used x-rays, because the TSA doesn&rsquo;t actually put that on the sign.</p>

<p>She did the rest.</p>

<p>When we got to the scanner, I opted out.  Then they opted out.  She&rsquo;d already convinced the family behind them to do the same.  Her response to the TSA agent was awesome, I wish I&rsquo;d thought of it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ma'am, please step over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No thanks, I&rsquo;ve already had cancer, just feel me up or whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the first 4 &ldquo;OPT-OUT&rdquo; calls, they just passed us all through the regular metal detector.  No one got groped.</p>

<p>Information, properly delivered, is power.</p>

<hr><p><em>Addendum</em> The revolt was emotionally satisfying, and I totally recommend doing it, but ultimately it&rsquo;s only a drop in the ocean.  From where I&rsquo;m sitting, I can see the security line, people holding their hands up in the little booth.</p>

<p>So, do make trouble.  On-the-ground rebellion is important.  But also tell your legislator. There&rsquo;s a senate oversight meeting tomorrow, so please <a href="http://hillwho.com/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=10&amp;sobi2Id=5651">call these people and tell them how you feel</a>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll leave a voicemail.  It&rsquo;s easy and takes 2 seconds.  Just call up and say &ldquo;I think that the TSA has gone too far. Body scanning and inappropriate groping are unconstitutional and wrong. If you want my vote, change the policy.&rdquo;</p>

<hr><p><em>Addendum 2</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter_wave_scanner">Millimeter wave scanners</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_X-ray">Backscatter X-Rays</a> are not the same thing.  But it wasn&rsquo;t clear which one was in use, and the TSA sign used the terms interchangeably in the fine print where it told you about the opt-out option.</p>

<p>Also, yes, it&rsquo;s true, the cancer risks are not well understood, and I absolutely committed the alarmist fallacy.  (&ldquo;But can you really take that risk!&rdquo;)  Unfortunately, people aren&rsquo;t as afraid of a police state as they are of cancer.  I maintain that I used my powers for Good.</p>
