<p>Ah, where to begin&hellip;</p>

<p>How about the fact that email works by making copy after copy.  If you sent me this, then there are a jillion &ldquo;copies of the original&rdquo; between your computer and mine.  I simply <em>can&rsquo;t</em> reliably destroy them all.  (<a href="http://nukefromorbit.ytmnd.com/">Well, maybe&hellip;</a>)</p>

<p>If it may contain confidential information, then why are you sending it via email?  And without so much as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a> encrypting it?  I know that PGP&rsquo;s only been around for like <strong>20 years</strong> now, so it&rsquo;s pretty new, but still.  Get on that.  It&rsquo;s integrated in every email mail client, and it&rsquo;s not too hard to use.</p>

<p>But even more worryingly, this little footer just seems profoundly odd.  It&rsquo;s asking me to do something based on the <em>sender&rsquo;s</em> intent.  How am I supposed to know if I&rsquo;m the intended recipient?  Should I guess that the sender doesn&rsquo;t know how to use email, and just whacks the Reply-All button like a drunken ape?</p>

<p>Sorry.  We&rsquo;re 10% of the way through the 21st century now.  You&rsquo;re expected to know how to use a technology that&rsquo;s been around for 40 years.  It&rsquo;s not my responsibility if you send something to the wrong person.</p>

<p>In the end, this is just a bit of unenforceable legalese that makes people feel more official, and it&rsquo;s complete trash.  It&rsquo;s the digital equivalent of tossing your Starbucks cup out the window on the highway.</p>
