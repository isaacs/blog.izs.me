<p>Google Voice&rsquo;s transcription does funny things to people singing Happy Birthday.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d include the audio, but it&rsquo;d be a copyright violation.</p>

<p>From my sister and brother-in-law.  What&rsquo;s funny is how close it is to what they actually were saying.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dean, yup the, and a Yahoo The, and year, I man stable are good, a jacuzzi to. I&rsquo;m going on man. Happy Birthday. And hey, we&rsquo;re good and I&rsquo;ll talk to you later. I love you bye. You were born. Bye.</p></blockquote>

<p>From my dad and stepmom.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi, Happy Birthday interview. Happy Birthday to You. Happy Birthday Dear Ryan, Happy Birthday to you, man, Randall. Alright then. Marry a man. Ohh man. Bye bye.</p></blockquote>

<p>Their support of gay marriage is nice (if somewhat misguided), but I wish they&rsquo;d remembered my name.  Seems like they struggled with that a bit.</p>
