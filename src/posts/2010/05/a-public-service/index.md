<dl><dt>He pushed the button, which was red.</dt>
<dd><p>There was a button.<br/>
The button was red. <br/>
He pushed it. <br/>
Use a comma.</p>
</dd>
<dt>He pushed the button that was red.</dt>
<dd>
<p>There were buttons. <br/>
One of those buttons was red. <br/> 
He pushed the red one. <br/>
No comma.</p>
</dd>
</dl><p>The comma separates the initial phrase from another extra bit of information about the thing.  In the first case, &ldquo;which&rdquo; stands in for &ldquo;the button&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s like saying, &ldquo;He pushed the button.  The button was red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the second case, there is no comma, because &ldquo;that&rdquo; is used as a limiter, not a reference.  It&rsquo;s like saying, &ldquo;He pushed the button.  That button, the one that&rsquo;s red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When you say &ldquo;that one&rdquo;, you point.  You are limiting the referent.</p>

<p>To make things more confusing, &ldquo;which&rdquo; can actually be used as a limiter, and sometimes limiters can be used to add information.  But when in doubt, follow these rules.</p>
