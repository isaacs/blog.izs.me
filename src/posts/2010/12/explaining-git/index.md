| **robg** | Awesome explanation of git: http://tartley.com/?p=1267 |
| **isaacs** | robg: i'm not sure that quite counts as an "explanation" |
| **robg** | isaacs: it's an explanation, just not one that clarifies anything |
| **isaacs** | haha |
| **rob** | PUSH YOUR FUCKING CODE! |
| **robg** | No, no, that's part of the operations manual... |
