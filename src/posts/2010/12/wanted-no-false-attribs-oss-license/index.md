<p>Anyone know of a license that says this?  If not, are there any lawyers out
there who wanna do lawyer stuff to this?</p>

<ol><li>You can use this thing for whatever purpose you want, commercial,
non-commercial, whatever, under the following terms:</li>
<li>You can distribute or sublicense this thing as much as you want,
provided the copyright and license remains attached to any reasonable
portion of the thing.</li>
<li>You cannot sell this thing for a profit without any meaningful
changes.  You can, however, sell a thing that is built using this
thing, or a thing that uses this thing as a component and adds
nontrivial functionality to it, or a thing
that links to this thing as a separate library, or pretty much anything other than
&ldquo;this exact thing and nothing else&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If you distribute this thing, whether for profit or not, and you&rsquo;ve made some meaningful changes, <strong>any
such changes must be clearly spelled out to the end user,
and the bug reporting contact information must be changed or removed.</strong></li>
</ol><p>I&rsquo;m ok with you using the stuff I build.  In fact, that&rsquo;s actually why I
build stuff, so people will use it.  And money is great, so using it
to make a profit?  That&rsquo;s so totally awesome.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also ok with you sharing the stuff I build.  I want people to use
it, and if you help that happen, then that&rsquo;s also great.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m super ok with you tinkering with the stuff I build.  Seriously.  Go
nuts on it.  Do stuff.  Rock on.  I&rsquo;d love to see what you do to it, but
if it&rsquo;s your secret project, I totally get that, too.</p>

<p>I just wish that, if you&rsquo;re going to change it, and then hand it out to
others, you didn&rsquo;t give me credit for the changes I didn&rsquo;t make.</p>
