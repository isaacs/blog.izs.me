<p>My last day at Yahoo will be 2010-01-22.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten an offer from <a href="http://proofpoint.com/">Proofpoint</a> which is too good to ignore.  The opportunity to drive the direction of a product at an early stage, including having a lot of input about the choice of technology and team, is very exciting.  Also, though this was not the primary factor, the position is significantly more financially rewarding than I believe that the next few years would be if I stayed at Yahoo.</p>

<p>Yahoo has been a mostly great company to work for, and <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a> is by far the best team that I&rsquo;ve worked on here.  It&rsquo;s a shame that I didn&rsquo;t join YUI sooner; I still feel like I just got here.  The quality of this team made the decision very difficult, and that says a lot about the job that Eric Miraglia and Thomas Sha have done building it.</p>

<p>If you ever get a chance to work at Yahoo, take it.</p>

<p>I feel so very fortunate to have met so many of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s bright minds in the last 4 years, and to have learned so much about the web, about business, about people, and about the science and art of software development.  I&rsquo;ve been a student, a teacher, an expert, an amateur, a mentor, and a mentee.</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for what you&rsquo;ve given me.</p>
