<p>Some time around That 70&rsquo;s Show, maybe earlier, but certainly post-Seinfeld, characters in sitcoms gained the ability to have a shared flashback to instantly and graphically communicate with one another.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s really odd is that they often know they can do this, and even make meta-jokes about this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Is there a word for this?  It seems to me to be something unique to the television storytelling medium, and fairly recent, and we all seem to Just Get It.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s neat.</p>
