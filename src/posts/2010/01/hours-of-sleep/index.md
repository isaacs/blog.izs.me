| **Seldo** | That doesn't really work for me as I naturally wake up every few hours |
| **Seldo** | I need a clock to tell me if another 2-hour cycle is safe |
| **Isaac** | crazy |
| **Seldo** | Because waking up halfway through a cycle breaks me for the whole day |
| **Isaac** | how are you not complete manic and anxious and crazy all the time? |
| **Seldo** | Have you met me? |
| **Isaac** | oh yeah, huh... |
