<blockquote><p>One of the most amazing parts of working at npm is the passion of our userbase.

This stuff just happens.</p>

<p>Yesterday at lunch, we got into a run of punny song titles based on musicals, leading to a series of tweets about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23npmthemusical&amp;src=typd">npm the musical</a>. By late that evening, what landed in our inbox? Full lyrics to one of the songs, courtesy of the astonishingly creative <a href="https://twitter.com/revin">Revin Guillen</a>. Not only is it a catchy song, it’s a surprisingly thorough overview of npm’s features and functionality. We are blown away.</p>

<h2>I Am The Very Model Of A Modern Package Manager</h2>

<p><em>(To the tune of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSGWoXDFM64&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=51s">I Am The Very Model Of A Modern Major General</a>.)</em></p>

<p>I am the very model of a modern package manager<br/>
I’ve information current, deprecated in my cache-ager<br/>
I know the code you write has other modules (“mod-you-uhls”) it depends on<br/>
And I collect it all for you from first the moment you log on</p>

<p>My registry with calculations teeming mathematical<br/>
Dependencies relationshipped by edges linked quite graph-ical<br/>
The versions, stars, and issues, bugs all published for the world to see<br/>
With many cheerful links to source control for the reposit'ry</p>

<p><em>With many cheerful links to source control for the reposit'ry</em><br/><em>With many cheerful links to source control for the reposit'ry</em><br/><em>With many cheerful links to source control for the reposiposit'ry</em></p>

<p>I’m very good at testing, tagging, publishing your libraries<br/>
I find the dupes and de- the dupes and you can rebuild all of these<br/>
In short, in matters JavaScript, dependency, and modular<br/>
I am the very model of a modern package manager</p>

<p><em>In short, in matters JavaScript, dependency, and modular</em><br/><em>It is the very model of a modern package manager</em></p>

<p>I know your repo’s history, can shrinkwrap all the deps you need<br/>
I answer all the queries, many millions served today indeed<br/>
I quote the docs to you when asked, or open them in Chrome at least<br/>
I’m active all the time, in time zones all the way from west to east</p>

<p>I can uninstall, unlink, unpublish, unstar, or just <code>un</code><br/>
I know your login name and I can <code>whoami</code> for everyone<br/>
My interface is quick and you can write instructions easily<br/>
Abbreviate commands so they’re as terse as ‘r’, ’s’, &lsquo;i’, and 'c’</p>

<p><em>Abbreviate commands so they’re as terse as 'r’, ’s’, 'i’, and 'c’</em><br/><em>Abbreviate commands so they’re as terse as 'r’, ’s’, 'i’, and 'c’</em><br/><em>Abbreviate commands so they’re as terse as 'r’, ’s’, 'i’, and 'i’ and 'c’</em></p>

<p>Then I can run-script all the things, lifecycle hooks I can perform<br/>
And tell you all about a package: <code>view</code> 'f you want me to inform<br/>
In short, in matters JavaScript, dependency, and modular<br/>
I am the very model of a modern package manager</p>

<p><em>In short, in matters JavaScript, dependency, and modular</em><br/><em>It is the very model of a modern package manager</em></p>

<p>In fact when I know what is meant by “version” or (heh) “verison”<br/>
When I can give you scripts to help your shell do tab comp-uh-letion<br/>
When certain variables are all there in the environment<br/>
I enter “plumbing mode”; my output’s based upon the arguments</p>

<p>When I have learnt what progress has been made by <code>npm upgrade</code><br/>
Or <code>npm update</code>, when identical operations made<br/>
In short, when registry’s upgraded underneath transparentlyj<br/>
You’ll say a better package manager had never ran à <a href="https://twitter.com/ceejbot">ceej</a></p>

<p>For my packager'il knowledge, though I’m plucky and adventury<br/>
Has really really taken off since funding came in ventury<br/>
But still in matters JavaScript, dependency, and modular<br/>
I am the very model of a modern package manager</p>

<p><em>But still in matters JavaScript, dependency, and modular</em><br/><em>It is the very model of a modern package manager</em></p></blockquote>
