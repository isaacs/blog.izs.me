<pre class="poem">
I met you on Live Journal way back in &lsquo;02
Lyin&rsquo; awake intent on following you
Animated graphics didn&rsquo;t stop you coming through
Oh-a-oh

They took the credit for all your bad poetry
Rewritten in 140 characters for free
And now I understand the Web 2 point 0 scene

Oh-a-oh
I faved your selfies
Oh-a-oh
What can you tell me?

Twitter hearts killed the favoriting star
Twitter hearts killed the favoriting star

On my phone, held in my palm
We can&rsquo;t unplug, we&rsquo;ve grown too calm
Whoa!
Oh-aoh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-aoh-oh-oh-oh

And now we meet-up in an invite-only Slack
Push-notified, but seems so long since you&rsquo;ve been back
And when you&rsquo;re lonely you can blame it all on @jack

Oh-a-oh
You were the first one
Oh-a-oh
You were the last one

Twitter hearts killed the favoriting star
Twitter hearts killed the favoriting star

On my phone, held in my palm
We can&rsquo;t unplug, we&rsquo;ve grown too calm
Too calm!

Oh-aoh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-aoh-oh-oh-oh

Alright

Twitter hearts killed the favoriting star
Twitter hearts killed the favoriting star
On my phone, held in my palm
We can&rsquo;t unplug, we&rsquo;ve grown too calm

Semantics changed and broke your heart
So put all the blame on pixel art

You are&hellip; the favoriting star
Twitter hearts killed the favoriting star
Twitter hearts killed that favoriting star, yes, it did
