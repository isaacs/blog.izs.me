> I'm really curious about the TJ node js story is he real? Or just screen name? According to one of the cuddletech blog posts he is real?

<p>TJ Holowaychuk is a real person.  So it TJ Fontaine.  They’re both real people that I’ve met in real life.  They have arms and legs and feelings and heads.  Well, just one head each, as far as I know.  I’m not sure which TJ you meant to ask about, but they’re both nice and definitely real.</p>
