After all the noise I've been making about Trump, one could
reasonably assume I'm a die-hard Democrat.

Those who've known me a bit longer may be surprised, since I have
also pulled hard in the past for the Libertarian angle.

Truth be told, the only unifying principle of my political belief
is anti-authoritarianism.

I believe that the role of government in a free society should be
to free individuals from tyranny, and I am deeply skeptical of
power granted to any authority.  That power must thus be tightly
limited, balanced, checked, and directed by the people for the
people.  We must only grant power when it is necessary to counter
some other form of tyranny.

Make no mistake: ALL power is tyranny, and NONE of us are
innocent of wielding it.  We have a moral duty to ensure that it
is balanced, checked, and restricted.

One of the most deadly forms of power in the world today is
American military power.  We have the most powerful military in
the world, by far, by any reasonable measure.  We are over-armed
to the point of absurdity.

Killing doesn't always mean bringing death.  Tyranny can also be
withholding life.  Another form of power that can be deadly is
the power to restrict and control access to nutrition, water,
medical care, shelter, and other resources.

My opposition to tyrannical authority is both moral and
pragmatic.

Morally, it offends my emotional sensibility for people to
interact as master and slave or as combatants.  It doesn't feel
good to be operating in a mode of violence, fear, and
desperation.  At best, it leads to a cycle of adrenaline and
cortisol that shuts down the best parts of our brains.  At worst,
it leads to horrors.

Pragmatically, it is also suboptimal from a systems theory point
of view.  No matter how well-informed, wise, and benevolent, an
authority will almost never have enough insight to make the right
decisions.  When the boss tells everyone what to do, the company
fails.  Better to push authority to where the information is,
whenever possible.

This idea of pushing authority to the edges, has informed how
I've tried to build my company, run open source projects, and
design products.  It's very challenging, and requires a lot of
trust and communication, but people work really well when they
have the right balance of alignment, competence, and autonomy.
I've tried being in charge all the time.  It's exhausting and
leads to bad outcomes.

In the American political spectrum, this makes me most closely
aligned with Social Democrats and Libertarians, the two groups
perhaps _most_ at odds with one another.  That's amusing to me.

I have often found other people to be enigmas, but I like
studying puzzles, especially the interaction of complex systems.
That's why I've loved open source communities and projects so
much, and why business and software are also really fun.  It's
not just debugging the computer, it's debugging the humans.
People provide the best puzzles!

I've read a lot of history and philosophy over the years.  Never
enough to be a real scholar, per se, but some of the best stories
are true stories.

The rise of Hitler always fascinated and disturbed me.  Of
course, everything gets distorted in hindsight.  Everyone rushes
to say he was monster NOW.  But the German people elected him.
They voted, and chose him, and supported him.  And it's not that
he "was a great speaker".  Accounts at the time painted him as
something of a blustering idiot.  He lied constantly, made
promises and claims that made no sense, talked about a return to
a glorious unified Germanic state that never existed.

It's not as if people at the time didn't call him out on it.
They did.  Again and again.  I once chalked it up to "people were
dumb in oldentimes", but the horror of the Third Reich is that
they _weren't_ dumb, not really.  They were just like us.  Less
connected, less informed, but not by much.  They were smart and
dedicated and trying to do what they thought was best.

And then they elected a monster of historic proportions.  "The
Nazis" are STILL the go-to villain for lazy screenwriters.

So when someone like Trump comes along, and he lies so casually
and constantly, it's really unique and fascinating to me, but
also very disturbing.  No other American politician does that.  I
mean, yeah, they all LIE, but in a completely different way.
Bush and Cheney and the gang lied about the WMDs in Iraq.  Bill
Clinton lied about getting a blowjob.  Every politician has
probably lied in countless ways that never come to light.

But that's just it; all those lies are the sort of thing that CAN
"come to light".  Because in those lies, the person is making up
a distinct and consistent factual reality, and trying to convince
us all of that reality.

Trump isn't.  He's just trying to win.  In every social
interaction, he's trying to be The Boss.  We're over here playing
a language game where the truth matters, but Trump isn't playing
that game.

Trump's game is to get himself into a position of power in this
interaction, and then to use that power to get into a position of
more power in the next interaction.  That's the point of his
game.  When he says "I didn't say that", it's only because the
other person accused him of something, and he knows that a flat
denial is the strongest response.  He doesn't care that you have
a recording of him saying it.  No one can be the boss of
recordings, so there's no point interacting with them.

There has likely never been, in the history of American politics,
a presidential candidate more directly opposed to everything I
believe in.  I find myself watching, with abject terror, as we
tread dreadfully close to putting someone functionally identical
to Hitler in charge of more than half of the modern world's
combined military power.

If he's elected, at some point, he's going to say "Bomb the hell
outta them!" because that's a badass thing to say in a meeting,
*and then actual bombs will kill actual people as a result*, and
there is no way in hell that he'll be measured or restrained in
how he does this, because he is never measured or restrained in
anything whatsoever.

He's exactly the kind of leader who'd use the FISA Courts to
accuse his opponents and protestors of "terrorism", which is
exactly the mechanism and function of the [Special
Courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sondergericht) in 1930s
Germany.

He's already suggested "rounding up" muslim-americans.

## so what do I believe in?

I support scaling back the American military complex
dramatically.  There are no functional checks on this power
anymore, and it has become a runaway empire.  It is immoral to
rule through force without granting political agency to the
nations we are dominating.

I support a universal basic income guarantee and universal
healthcare and education.  People are not free when they live
under the constant threat of losing their food, shelter, or
health, or when they don't have the mental toolkit to reason
about the world around them.

I support Black Lives Matter, same-sex marriage, respect for
native peoples' land, equal opportunity housing and employment,
and slavery reparations.  People are not free when they are
second-class citizens.  We can't eradicate centuries of racism,
sexism, or homophobia in one fell swoop, but we can chip away at
it diligently.

I oppose citizenship and immigration control except as necessary
for controlling the spread of diseases (including plant- and
animal-borne pathogens).  The restriction of human movement
prevents efficient distribution of labor, reduces overall
happiness, and quickly becomes a vector for abuse.  Participation
within a community should be determined, as it most commonly was
throughout history, by residence within that community.

Taxation is a form of tyranny, but it's far less offensive than
slow starvation or fast bullets.  My heart breaks for the souls
we force unnecessarily through hell on earth, and for the future
that has lost the art and invention and inspiration that they
could have offered.
