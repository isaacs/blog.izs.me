> The corollary of constant change is ignorance. This is not often talked about: we computer experts barely know what we’re doing. We’re good at fussing and figuring out. We function well in a sea of unknowns. Our experience has only prepared us to deal with confusion. A programmer who denies this is probably lying, or else is densely unaware of himself

<p>-Ellen Ullman, <em>Close to the Machine</em></p>

<p>This is the paragraph of the book that made me finally realize it was okay and actually good to be in a constant state of terror as a software developer.</p>

<p>It gets worse when you switch to the management track, and worse still if you start a company.</p>
