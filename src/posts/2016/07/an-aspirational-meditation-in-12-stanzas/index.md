<p>On each in-breath, I hold the first word.  On the out breath, I hold the second word, and bring the feeling of that concept to the part of my body referenced (head, eyes, mouth/throat, heart, gut).</p>

<p>I try to consider that each term is both an adjective, and thus a thing to aspire to (a True Heart, an Open Vision, etc.) as well as a verb instructing me how to attain that state.</p>

<p>When I notice my mind has wanderd, I try to pick up where I left off, or back at the beginning.</p>

<p>This is how I&rsquo;ve been going to sleep lately, unless I&rsquo;m too tired to do anything but breath counting.  When I have time, I try to go through it in the shower as well.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s making me a better person, but it feels good to remind myself that I aspire to be curious, capable, and compassionate.</p>
