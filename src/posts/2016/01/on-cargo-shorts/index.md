<blockquote><p>Here’s the thing. We’ve given up on style. We can’t keep up. We have too many kids and not enough time, and when we go out on a weekend day to do a bunch of stuff, we need pockets. We need them for wallets and dolls and water bottles and an extra pull-up, maybe a sippy cup or a phone or two. We aren’t concerned about whether you like them. We are trying to get through this phase of our lives, which, quite frankly, requires more pocket space than we ever expected. Let us live. CRGO 4 LYF.</p></blockquote>
