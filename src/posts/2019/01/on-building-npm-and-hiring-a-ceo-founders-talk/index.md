I had the opportunity to chat with Adam Stacoviak recently about the
journey of creating npm and turning that into npm, Inc., 4 and a half
years as CEO, and the transition to my new role as Chief Product
Officer.  Along the way, we touched on some of the long dark teatimes
of the soul one goes through when contemplating handing your company
over to a new leader, after pouring your heart into it for so long.
