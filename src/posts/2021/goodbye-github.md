I'm leaving GitHub!

After 12 years of working on npm, from [an
idea](https://groups.google.com/g/nodejs/c/erDWyS4xPw8/m/E09EInE7NAwJ) to a
[side project](https://github.com/npm/cli/commit/4626dfa73) to [a
startup](https://venturebeat.com/2014/02/11/former-node-leader-takes-big-money-launches-node-startup/)
and [that startup's acquisition at
GitHub](https://blog.izs.me/2020/03/next-phase-montage/), I'm moving on to
a new challenge.

The last few years at GitHub have been great.  It's an awesome company
filled with great people, doing interesting things in the developer space,
and I'm honored to have been a part of it for a while.  But it's also a
bigger company than I'm accustomed to.  I'm happiest and most productive
when I'm hyperfocused and moving at the speed of a startup.

A new opportunity came my way recently, and it's too enticing for me to
pass up.  I figure I've only got one or two more of these left in me, so
it's time to move onto the next adventure.

The [npm CLI](https://github.com/npm/cli) team is in a better place today
than it's ever been, and I have full confidence in their ability to
continue to shepherd it into the future.  The
[registry](https://www.npmjs.com) is being managed by a professional team
focused on improving usability and security.  I'll still be involved as an
open source contributor, but they got this, and I'm looking forward
to watching what they accomplish.
