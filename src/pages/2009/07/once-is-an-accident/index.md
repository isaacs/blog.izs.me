| **richtaur** | i love cats |
| **richtaur** | we were talking yesterday about how perfect they are |
| **richtaur** | they're self-cleaning!! |
| **richtaur** | can you name one other animal that can realistically go months or years without a bath? |
| **richtaur** | a dog would be stinking up your shit |
| **richtaur** | i mean i guess you wouldn't bathe a hamster but they're lame anyway |
| **isaac_schlueter** | they are. |
| **isaac_schlueter** | the best thing about hamsters is feeding them to cats. |
| **richtaur** | i did that accidentally once! |
| **richtaur** | actually twice |
