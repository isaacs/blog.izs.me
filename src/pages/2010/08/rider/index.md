<p>The rollercoaster moves up and down.  I am not the vehicle, but the rider within it.</p>

<p>Feet tap the pavement in hypnotic rhythm, legs pounding the heart demanding more more more.  I am not those legs or that heart.  I ride in telepathic communication with this animal, feed it, bathe it, lay it down to rest.</p>

<p>The internal computer calculates risk, strategy, weighs pros and cons.  It races through analysis working what it knows into speculations of the future.  I ask it questions and watch the output.</p>

<p>I am not these feelings.  I am not this body.  I am not this mind.</p>

<p>This vehicle takes me where I steer it.  I am the sum that decides which parts to make whole.</p>
