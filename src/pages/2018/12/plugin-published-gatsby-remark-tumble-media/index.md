Slight update on the [port of this site to
Gatsby](/2018/12/porting-to-gatsby).  I published the tumblr-esque
media handling bits as a standalone plugin.  It's now available [on
npm](http://npm.im/gatsby-remark-tumble-media).

If you try it out, [please let me know](/ask)!  I'd love to see if
anyone else finds it useful.
