> re: the bathtub analogy in your 'captioning at jsconf' post-- Joel Spolsky used it in a post from 2000 at joelonsoftware, so that might be the source. (I can't link here, but searching 'joelonsoftware bathtub grab bars' should work.) I just stumbled across it today and remembered your post! :) -Zara
