<h2>To my good and kind hearted conservative friends and relatives:</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s always challenging to learn about the history leading up to the Third Reich and Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power. How didn&rsquo;t they see it coming? Why didn&rsquo;t anyone stop him?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s such a horrible series of events that any comparison to it seems not just inaccurate, but an outrageously cruel and inappropriate joke.</p>

<p>However, it is no exaggeration to say that we are in such a situation now, where historians of the future may ask why we didn&rsquo;t stop the rise of a brutal fascist dictator who overturned the rule of law and performed unspeakable evil. Like the Germans who elected Hitler to power, you are good people, but many of you may not see the stakes of your choice or the power to do Good that rests in your hands.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is not just a buffoon. He knows what he&rsquo;s doing, and he&rsquo;s following a script which has been horrifyingly successful numerous times in the past.</p>

<p>I know you probably don&rsquo;t love Hillary. I don&rsquo;t either. But she is not a fascist. Trump will possibly be even worse than Hitler was. Imagine Hitler with the power of nuclear weapons and the modern American military.</p>

<p>Call on your fellow conservatives to answer for Trump&rsquo;s fascism before voting for him. Ask them if they are willing to take their share of the blame for the unspeakable horrors he is explicitly and openly planning.</p>

<p>This is 2016. Everything is recorded, and Trump makes no apologies or excuses for his plans. History will remember that you should have known what you were doing.</p>
