This is the blog of Isaac Z. Schlueter.

It is staticly generated using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/),
and fronted by Cloudflare CDN.

It was
[imported](https://github.com/isaacs/blog.izs.me/tree/master/import)
from in its previous home on Tumblr, and uses a
[plugin](https://github.com/isaacs/gatsby-remark-tumble-media/)
that makes it possible to do a lot of tumblr-ish media things using
markdown frontmatter yaml.

All of the content and code is available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/isaacs/blog.izs.me/) and you are welcome to
[report any problems you
encounter](https://github.com/isaacs/blog.izs.me/issues).

The code is exposed in the hopes that others may find it useful.  You
are welcome to read and learn from it, and copy techniques and ideas.
However, you may not clone the design or content without written
permission.  Please [get in touch](/ask) if you have any questions.
