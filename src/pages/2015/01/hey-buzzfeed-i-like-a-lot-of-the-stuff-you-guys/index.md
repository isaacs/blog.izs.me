> Hey Buzzfeed. I like a lot of the stuff you guys do, but I've noticed something lately that makes me (and I assume a lot of other people) question whether or not to read your website. It seems like a disproportionate number of your articles and videos cater to women and so-called "feminists". This very blog recently posted a picture that mocked the new and popular #Meninist activist movement. Do you REALLY want your readers to think you support so-called "feminist" ideology?
