<blockquote><p>Some points to consider:

</p><ul><li>being out is <b>never an obligation</b></li>
<li>being out is not an indicator of pride, courage, strength, or anything other than a person’s decision to be out</li>
<li>being out is often a major risk, and coming out and staying out is often a mark of privilege to which not everyone has access</li>
<li>being out isn’t always universal, a person can be out to some people and not others, or in some places not others</li>
<li>consequently, never assume that because someone is out to you, they’re out to <b>anyone</b> else</li>
<li>and, it should go without saying, never ever out anyone</li>
<li>lastly, the language of “coming out” belongs to gender and sexual minorities, and there is never a time for people to “come out” as anything else, including as an “ally” to LGBTQ people – no appropriating</li></ul></blockquote>
