This is the blog of [Isaac Z. Schlueter](https://izs.me).

It is staticly generated using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and
hosted on Netlify. It started as the [eleventy base blog
template](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), but has
changed a lot since.

All of the content and code is available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/isaacs/blog.izs.me/) and you are
welcome to [report any problems you
encounter](https://github.com/isaacs/blog.izs.me/issues).

The code is exposed in the hopes that others may find it useful.
You are welcome to read and learn from it, and copy techniques
and ideas. However, you may not clone the design or content
without written permission. Please get in touch if you have any
questions.

If you want to reach me, I can be found in various places around
the internet, roughly order of effectiveness:

- [@isaacs.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/isaacs.bsky.social)
- [isaacs\_ on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/isaacs_)
- [isaacs on GitHub](https://github.com/isaacs)

- or you can use the email address on my
  [resume](https://izs.me), but good chance it'll get lost in the
  sea of spam.

This is what I look like, kind of.
