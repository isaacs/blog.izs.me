<h2>Newcomb Programming Languages</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox">Newcomb&rsquo;s Problem</a>
is a very divisive thought experiment in decision theory. The tl;dr version is:</p>

<p>A supreme intelligence Omega comes down from the sky, and offers you
two boxes, labeled A and B.  In box A, Omega has placed $1000.</p>

<p>Omega makes a prediction about whether you will open only one box, or
both boxes.  If Omega predicts that you will open both boxes, then box
B is empty.  If Omega predicts that you will open only one box, then
Omega places $1000000 in box B.</p>

<p>In over a million trials, Omega has never incorrectly predicted
someone&rsquo;s decision.  (Supreme intelligence is supreme!)</p>

<p>Omega places both boxes before you, and flies away to torment some
other decision theorist.</p>

<p>Do you open both boxes, or just box B?</p>

<p>Well, you figure, Omega is gone now, its prediction already in the
past.  At this point, if I open both boxes, then I&rsquo;ll get either $1000
or $1001000.  If I open only box B, then I&rsquo;ll get either $0 or
$1000000.  Regardless of Omega&rsquo;s prediction, I&rsquo;m always better off
opening both boxes.</p>

<p>So you open box B, and find it empty.</p>

<p>You lament that Omega seemingly rewards &ldquo;improper&rdquo; decision theorists,
and treat yourself to $1000 worth of whatever.  Since you&rsquo;re a
dedicated rationalist, you probably make a bunch of sound investments
with it and end up doing ok anyway.</p>

<p>Good for you.</p>

<p>Another approach is to commit to opening only box B, and stick to that
commitment.  Decision theory be damned, I want a million bucks.
Before doing anything else, you set box A on fire, just to be sure.
You open box B, and get a million dollars.</p>

<p>What use is a decision theory if it doesn&rsquo;t optimize outcomes?  That&rsquo;s
not to say that it&rsquo;s worthless to study the science of priors and
statistics and possible outcomes.  Certainly, in most situations, we
are not dealing with supreme intelligences handing out money
capriciously.  But in the real world, there <em>are</em> occasionally
situations where the ends matter more than being theoretically
correct.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perhaps a purity of theoretical correctness is an
important part of one&rsquo;s self-image.  Maybe it imparts emotional
satisfaction that a million dollars just can&rsquo;t buy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to be a two-boxer.  In a way, I respect it, like a
monk or an artist.  There&rsquo;s a beauty in that purity.</p>

<p>But still.  Fuck that, I want the money.  I can be a monk later.</p>

<hr><p>Most programming languages are to some extent art projects.  There&rsquo;s a
lot of subjectivity to them.  They exist to seek a beautiful ideal.</p>

<p>Most programming languages are also to some extent practical.  You can
do real stuff with them.  They exist to make stuff.</p>

<p>The difference is, when tradeoffs must be made between &ldquo;beautiful
ideal&rdquo; and &ldquo;make stuff&rdquo;, what wins?</p>

<p>If our ideal is in fact beautiful, and if we are skilled in our
pursuit of it, then one might expect that these trade-offs will be
infrequent.  The most beautiful programming language is the one that
is the most pragmatic.</p>

<p>But like boxes of money, programming languages do not exist in a
vacuum.  We have imperfect vision, and may find ourselves heading down
a blind alley to explore what we hope will be beautiful.  In the
making of things, we may find that it was a mistake, and that the only
way out is to choose to either make the language more beautiful (and
lose pragmatic value for its current users) or preserve pragmatic
value (and give up on some potential beauty).</p>

<p>Both choices are fraught with hazard.  The first can alienate the
community.  The second can lead to a mongrel language with warts and
bad parts.</p>

<p>Making software is the purpose of a programming language.  That is the
winning condition.  Valuing something other than that seems to me akin
to opening both boxes, because decision theory said so.</p>

<p>In box A, Omega has placed beauty.  In box B, Omega has placed
pragmatism and community, but only if Omega predicts that you will
only choose box B.  Omega has never been wrong.</p>

<p>Make your choice.</p>

<p>Except, in this version, you can open B, and get pragmatism and
community.  But once opened, if you choose A, then the community will
eventually be lost.</p>

<p>I can see the value in a beautiful thing.  But for myself,
willy-nilly, I like useful software and happy communities more than
programming languages for their own sake.</p>

<p>This is why I love JavaScript so much.  Fuck beautiful code, I wanna
make a web page.  We&rsquo;d rather lack a feature than add something
that&rsquo;ll break anything.  We drag the albatross of ancient websites
along with us, and while this is often a curse, it is also a sort of
blessing.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a one-boxer language.</p>
